Industry governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) solutions are document-oriented and expert-driven. Formal compliance checking techniques in contrast attempt to provide ways for rigorous modeling and analysis of regulatory compliance but miss out on holistic GRC perspective due to missing integration between diverse set of (semi-) formal models. We show that streamlining regulatory compliance using multiple purposive models of various aspects of regulations, it is possible to leverage both the rigor of formal techniques and the holistic enterprise GRC perspective. Our contributions are twofold. First, we present a model-driven architecture based on a conceptual model of integrated GRC that is capable of addressing key challenges of regulatory compliance. Second, using Know Your Customer regulations in Indian context as a case study, we demonstrate the utility of this architecture. Initial results with KYC regulations are promising and point to further work in model-driven regulatory compliance.","2015-09","2025-02-19 14:51:09","2025-02-19 14:51:09","","436-445","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Law; Adaptation models; Business; Industries; Semantics; Vocabulary","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study addresses the necessity for accurate and efficient personal credit risk assessment systems, focusing on rectifying credit data imbalances and developing a high-performing credit risk prediction model. To tackle data imbalance, deep learning’s Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is employed for oversampling, learning the distribution of default samples within high-risk financial groups. “New” default samples are then integrated into the original dataset to achieve a balanced representation of default and normal samples. In the era of big data, marked by a surge in personal credit data dimensions and sample numbers, an advanced ensemble learning model, the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), is combined with the GAN model for credit risk prediction. The study utilizes six different imbalance ratio datasets from the Knowledge Extraction based on Evolutionary Learning platform to experiment with the GAN model’s classification effectiveness. Additionally, consumer finance company credit data, consisting of 559 features, undergoes data preprocessing and feature extraction to validate the LightGBM-GAN model’s effectiveness for credit risk prediction. Experimental results reveal that: (1) GAN significantly improves risk information classification (achieving an 86.7% accuracy), outperforming traditional oversampling methods on multiple datasets; (2) The LightGBM-GAN model excels in Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic values (averaging 0.86 and 0.87, respectively), establishing itself as an effective credit risk prediction model; (3) Feature importance identified by the LightGBM model underscores the predictive potential of financial weakly correlated variables, such as consumer behavior data. This study strives to equip financial institutions with efficient and precise credit risk assessment tools, ensuring compliance with laws and regulations, averting legal risks, reducing NPL risks, and fortifying the stability of the financial system.","2024","2025-02-19 14:51:09","2025-02-19 14:51:09","","146244-146255","","","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Training; Data models; Generators; Accuracy; generative adversarial network; Generative adversarial networks; Gradient methods; legal prevention; light gradient boosting machine; Predictive models; Risk assessment; Risk management; risk prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents a novel Hybrid Model Integrating Transformer-based Architecture (HMTBA) using BERT and Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) for enhanced legal risk prediction in B2B e-commerce. The proposed hybrid deep learning model addresses the growing complexities in contract compliance, legal disputes, and transactional analysis by combining the strengths of BERT for textual understanding and VAE for dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional structured data. The model was evaluated against nine existing models, including CNN, RNN, GRU, LSTM, Transformer, XGBoost, BERT, VAE, and Hybrid CNN-LSTM, using a dataset of 4318 data points consisting of B2B transactions, legal case studies, contracts, and compliance reports. The proposed HMTBA model achieved superior performance with an accuracy of 95.82%, precision of 93.72%, recall of 94.35%, and F1-score of 94.03%. This significant improvement over existing models demonstrates the potential of HMTBA to enhance legal risk management and improve contract compliance in B2B e-commerce.

Analysis of complex and voluminous legal text can benefit from the automation and traceability of logic-based models. We propose such a model based on norms. Norms are legal rights and associated duties expressed in regulatory documents. Such norm models help reason about available rights and required duties based on the satisfiability of situations, a state-of-affair, in a given scenario. But model extraction from natural language as well as compliance reasoning in complex scenarios needs subject matter expertise. Our method enables modular norm model extraction and reasoning. For extraction, using the theory of frame-semantics we construct two foundational norm templates that cover Hohfeld's concepts of claim-right and its jural correlative, duty. Template instantiations from legal text result in a repeatable method for extraction of modular norm models. For reasoning, we introduce the notion of a super-situation. Super-situations contain other norm models. Compliance results from a modular norm are propagated to its containing super-situation, which in turn participates in other modular norms. This modularity allows on-demand incremental modeling and reasoning using simpler model primitives than previous approaches.","2017-11","2025-02-19 14:51:09","2025-02-19 14:51:09","","657-662","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Law; Privacy; Natural language processing; compliance; norms; satisfiability; Semantics; Analytical models; applicability; Cognition; Frame semantics; Hohfeld rights; laws","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A method to acquire finite state machines (FSM) from stakeholder rights and obligations for compliance monitoring is proposed. Rights and obligations define what people are permitted or required to do; these rights and obligations affect software requirements and design. The FSM allows stakeholders, software developers and compliance officers to trace events through the invocation of rights and obligations as pre- and post-conditions. Compliance is monitored by instrumenting runtime systems to report these events and detect violations. Requirements and software engineers specify the rights and obligations, and apply the method using three supporting tasks: 1) identify under-specifications, 2) balance rights with obligations, and 3) generate finite state machines. Preliminary validation of the method includes FSMs generated from U.S. healthcare regulations and tool support to parse these specifications and generate the FSMs.","2010-09","2025-02-19 14:51:09","2025-02-19 14:51:09","","17-26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Monitoring; Law; Privacy; Software; Semantics; Medical services","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite advances in the Requirements Engineering (RE) community on legal compliance analysis, important obstacles remain in developing accurate and generalizable compliance automation solutions. This paper highlights some observed limitations of current approaches and examines how adopting new automation strategies that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) can help address these shortcomings and open up fresh opportunities. Specifically, we argue that the examination of (textual) legal artifacts should, first, employ a broader context than sentences, which have widely been used as the units of analysis in past research. Second, the mode of analysis with legal artifacts needs to shift from classification and information extraction to more end-to-end strategies that are not only accurate but also capable of providing explanation and justification. We present a compliance analysis approach designed to address these limitations. We further outline our evaluation plan for the approach and provide preliminary evaluation results based on data processing agreements (DPAs) that must comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Our initial findings suggest that our approach yields substantial accuracy improvements and, at the same time, provides justification for compliance decisions.","2024-06","2025-02-19 14:51:09","2025-02-19 14:51:09","","432-440","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISSN: 2332-6441","","","","GDPR; Law; Regulation; Legal Requirements; Legal Compliance; Large language models; GPT-4; Large Language Models; Accuracy; Automation; Data processing; Information retrieval","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The goal of the PhD work is to develop business process and regulations compliance management technology which should enable business process construction from regulations and change monitoring of regulations and business processes to ensure easy and rapid modification of business process model or regulations, thus also ensuring compliance.","2014-08","2025-02-19 14:51:09","2025-02-19 14:51:09","","489-493","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISSN: 2332-6441","","","","Monitoring; compliance; regulations; business process; Analytical models; Organizations; Standards organizations; Conferences; Couplings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper proposes a formal specification language for contracts, called Symboleo, where contracts consist of collections of obligations and powers that define the legal contract's compliant executions. The formal semantics of Symboleo is based on an extension of an ontology for Law and is described in terms of logical axioms on statecharts that describe the lifetimes of contracts, obligations and powers. Our proposal includes a preliminary evaluation through the specification of a real life-inspired Sale-of-Goods contract, with a prototype execution engine.

Parties' actions influence the status of a contract and shall comply with its clauses. Manual contract monitoring is very laborious in real markets, such as transactive energy, where plenty of complex contracts are running concurrently. Furthermore, liability, right and performance transition through run-time operations such as subcontracting, assignment and substitution complicate contract interpretation. Automation is needed to ensure that contracts respect desirable properties and to support monitoring of compliance and handling of violations. In this thesis research, I propose an innovative ontology that defines fundamental contractual notions (such as the ones mentioned above) and their relationships, on which is built a specification language, called Symboleo, that provides syntax and axiomatic semantics of contracts via first-order logic.

The intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and law holds potential to transform how legal professionals, including lawyers and judges, operate, resolve disputes, and retrieve case information to formulate their decisions. To identify the current state of the applications of Transformers (also known as Large Language Models or LLMs) in the legal domain, we analysed the existing literature from 2017 to 2023 through a database search and snowballing method. From 61 selected publications, we identified key application categories such as legal document analysis, case prediction, and contract review, along with their main characteristics. We observed a discernible upsurge in the volume of scholarly publications, a diversification of tasks undertaken (e.g., legal research, contract analysis, and regulatory compliance), and an increased range of languages considered. There has been a notable enhancement in the methodological sophistication employed by researchers in practical applications. The performance of models grounded in the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) architecture has consistently improved across various legal domains, including contract review, legal document summarization, and case outcome prediction. This paper makes several significant contributions to the field. Firstly, it identifies emerging trends in the application of LLMs within the legal domain, highlighting the growing interest and investment in this area. Secondly, it pinpoints methodological gaps in current research, suggesting areas where further development and refinement are needed. Lastly, it discusses the broader implications of these advancements for real-world legal tasks, offering insights into how LLM-based AI can enhance legal practice while addressing the associated challenges.","2025","2025-02-19 14:51:10","2025-02-19 14:51:10","","18253-18276","","","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Artificial intelligence; Law; Natural language processing; law; Contracts; Transformers; AI for law; Attention mechanisms; Databases; GPT; legal NLP; legal tech; literature review; Quality assessment; Question answering (information retrieval); Reliability; Systematic literature review; transformers","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To ensure that compliance requirements are continuouslymet, there is a need for frameworks that not only support modeling regulations, but also capture the potential environment variabilities and conditions in a systematic way. This paper introduces Variability-Aware Legal-GRL (Goal-oriented Requirements Language) framework for modeling compliance requirements in the presence of runtime changes.

This work investigates the automation of the Requirement, Applicability, Selection, and Exception (RASE) methodology for building regulatory compliance through the utilization of Large Language Models (LLMs) and active learning techniques. Specifically, we focus on the development and assessment of a system using the OpenAI GPT-4o model to transmute building regulation texts into structured YAML formats conducive to ACC processes. The study encompasses three experimental paradigms: few-shot learning, fine-tuning learning, and progressive active learning. Initial results from the few-shot learning experiment illustrate the model’s preliminary ability to interpret and process regulatory texts with limited examples. Fine-tuning enhances model performance by training it on a specialized dataset, thereby improving structural and textual accuracy. Progressive active learning, by iteratively incorporating expert feedback, further refines the accuracy of the model. The findings demonstrate substantial enhancements in both structural and semantic accuracies of the generated YAML files, underscoring the potential of integrating LLMs with active learning to streamline regulatory compliance automation.

This paper delves into the intricate relationship between AI applications in finance and the regulatory environment governing them. We explore the current regulatory landscape, identifying key areas of concern such as data privacy, ethical use of AI, transparency, and accountability. Through a comprehensive literature survey, we highlight the evolving nature of regulatory guidelines across different jurisdictions and the implications for stakeholders in the financial ecosystem. Our proposed work introduces a novel framework designed to assist financial institutions in navigating these complexities, ensuring that AI applications are developed and deployed in a manner that is compliant with existing and foreseeable regulatory requirements. The framework is underpinned by algorithms that facilitate compliance checks and risk assessments, incorporating mathematical models to predict regulatory alignment and potential breaches. We present the implementation of our framework through a series of case studies, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing compliance processes.

In highly regulated domains such as healthcare, there is a need for more comprehensive standards that can be used to assure that system requirements conform to regulations.

In this work, we apply the process to the privacy rule from the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). We present our methodology for extracting and prioritizing rights and obligations from regulations and show how semantic models can be used to clarify ambiguities through focused elicitation and to balance rights with obligations.

To demonstrate the benefits to an environmental agency that uses a reporting system with essentially free reporting information, a model with a reporting system is rigorously compared to one without. By calculating and comparing Nash equilibria over a range of values of model parameters, the conditions under which whistle-blowing can be truly effective are identified.

The framework, which draws on work in requirements specification languages and requirements comparison, allows engineers and legal experts to systematically simplify compliance and determine both high and low standards of care, while maintaining traceability back to the original legal text.

This paper details how developing production rule models can aid in acquiring software requirements from regulatory texts. Production rules enable requirements engineers to gain valuable domain knowledge of a particular legal text by providing the ability to receive precise answers to a specific query. In particular, a production rule model facilitates communication between requirements engineers and legal domain experts, supports and augments requirements elicitation, and resolves ambiguity. Prior work in this area has failed to detail a precise methodology for translating a legal text into production rules, and considered using production rule models for aiding requirements elicitation and validation. This paper introduces our production rule modeling methodology, and demonstrates this methodology using examples from a production rule model for four sections of the U.S. Heath Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).","2009-08","2025-02-19 14:51:10","2025-02-19 14:51:10","","101-110","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISSN: 2332-6441","","","","Requirements engineering; Law; Privacy; Knowledge engineering; regulatory compliance; logic programming; production rule modeling; Legal factors; Protection; Production; Insurance; Government; Legislation; Costs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, current autonomous vehicles prioritize safety and collision avoidance primarily in their decision-making and planning, which will lead to misunderstandings and distrust from human drivers and may even result in accidents in mixed traffic flow. Therefore, ensuring the compliance of the autonomous driving decision-making system is essential for ensuring the safety of autonomous driving and promoting the widespread adoption of autonomous driving technology. To this end, the paper proposes a trigger-based layered compliance decision-making framework. This framework utilizes the decision intent at the highest level as a signal to activate an online violation monitor that identifies the type of violation committed by the vehicle. Then, a four-layer architecture for compliance decision-making is employed to generate compliant trajectories. Using this system, autonomous vehicles can detect and correct potential violations in real-time, thereby enhancing safety and building public confidence in autonomous driving technology. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated on the DJI AD4CHE highway dataset under four typical highway scenarios: speed limit, following distance, overtaking, and lane-changing. The results indicate that the proposed method increases the vehicle's overall compliance rate from 13.85% to 84.46%, reduces the proportion of active violations to 0%, and only slightly decreases the vehicle's traffic efficiency by 2.7%, demonstrating its effectiveness.","2024-08","2025-02-19 14:51:10","2025-02-19 14:51:10","","5284-5298","","8","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Law; model predictive control; Safety; Autonomous vehicles; Decision making; decision-making; Planning; road traffic law; Road transportation; Trajectory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years, there have been reports of breaches of personal data either from organizations that collected it or from mischievous third parties. The global responses against the breaches have been the enactment of various policies and regulations to protect personal data against all forms of potential abuses. Nigeria Data Protection Regulation was also issued as the regulatory framework for personal data and privacy protection on Nigerian soil. This paper, aimed at analysing the state of compliance of Ministries, Departments, and Agencies with the regulatory framework. An online questionnaire was designed and hosted on Google Forms. The link to the questionnaire was sent to 110 staff, selected based on convenience, and representing various Ministries, Departments, and Agencies. The results have shown that about 70% of the organizations were aware of the provision of Nigeria Data Protection Regulation but only 34% indicated that they started the implementation. Nonetheless, about 45% Ministries, Departments, and Agencies completed the preparatory stage of compliance as they indicated that they have conducted detailed audits on their organizational operations to determine the changes and the new practices required to comply with the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation. The surveyed organizations indicated 37% to 60% compliance with other components of Nigeria Data Protection Regulation.

Although excessive healthcare regulation is a bad thing, regulatory compliance may bring with it many benefits, such as market entry, product quality and availability, as well as access to tax rebates and financial incentives. Goal-oriented regulations, in particular, embody in their formulation specific propositions to maximize compliance benefits provided the achievement of public policy goals. In this paper, we develop an in-depth study of goal-oriented healthcare equipment regulations. We use expert knowledge and process-mining techniques to investigate what goes on with regulatory compliance and with the benefits obtained by equipment manufacturers when the healthcare equipment regulation is goal-oriented. We present here a multi-company exploratory case study on the variability of mean times-to-benefit after compliance and on regulatory process improvement, focused on the diagnostic imaging equipment segment and the regulatory context in Brazil. We show that, in some cases, mean times-to-benefit depend on the compliance of different categories of diagnostic imaging equipment with technical requirements found in the applicable norms. Moreover, we present process improvement cases elicited during goal-oriented regulatory process analysis and modeling activities. Our study illustrates the usefulness of applying expert knowledge and process mining techniques together in the healthcare equipment domain. It also suggests that healthcare equipment product-management practices should be concerned not only with analyzing and ensuring regulatory compliance but also with regulation dynamics.","2020","2025-02-19 14:51:10","2025-02-19 14:51:10","","58559-58574","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Regulation; Analytical models; Finance; Medical services; Diagnostic imaging equipment; Economics; goal-oriented regulation; healthcare processes; Imaging; public policy; Public policy; regulatory requirements","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ideally, experts trained in law will analyze and interpret legal texts to inform the software requirements process. However, in small companies and development teams with short launch cycles, individuals with little or no legal training will be responsible for compliance. Two specific challenges commonly faced by non-experts are deciding if their system is covered by a law, and then deciding whether two legal requirements are similar or different. In this study, we assess the ability of laypersons, technical professionals, and legal experts to judge the similarity between legal coverage conditions and requirements. In so doing, we discovered that legal experts achieved higher rates of consensus more frequently than technical professionals or laypersons and that all groups had slightly greater agreement when judging coverage conditions than requirements, measured by Fleiss' K. When comparing judgments between groups using a consensus-based Cohen's Kappa, we found that technical professionals and legal experts exhibited consistently greater agreement than that found between laypersons and legal experts, and that each group tended towards different justifications, such as laypersons and technical professionals tendency towards categorizing different coverage conditions or requirements as equivalent if they believed them to possess the same underlying intent.","2014-08","2025-02-19 14:51:10","2025-02-19 14:51:10","","273-282","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISSN: 2332-6441","","","","Law; Training; compliance; legal requirements; Standards; Companies; legal coverage; Mobile communication; statutory interpretation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These infrastructures introduce multifaceted challenges in legal, ethical, financial, and technological (LEFT) domains, highlighting the critical need for a comprehensive framework to navigate the complexities within these domains and facilitate successful implementation. This viewpoint paper presents version 1.0 of a roadmap for eHealth implementation concerning LEFT domains and provides a preliminary overview of key preconditions essential for successful implementation. The roadmap is constructed based on the LEFT barriers and facilitators identified in an earlier study, systematically translating these insights into specific preconditions for successful implementation. Legal preconditions emphasize the necessity of effective data privacy and security measures, along with a comprehensive regulatory compliance framework. Ethical preconditions focus on facilitating patient understanding and control, enhancing consent processes, and implementing robust validations mechanisms for eHealth technologies. Financial preconditions advocate for fostering public-private stakeholder collaboration, establishing a financially sustainable business model, and developing eHealth reimbursement strategies. Technological preconditions include promoting interoperability between different data systems, enhancing data and system quality, and improving usability and accessibility of eHealth technologies. While this paper introduces version 1.0 of the roadmap and outlines the LEFT preconditions for eHealth implementation, effective implementation also requires collaborative decision-making among multidisciplinary stakeholders. Recognizing the need for a holistic approach, these preconditions necessitate careful consideration and systematic planning, with the roadmap serving as guidance to address the challenges of creating a successful eHealth infrastructure.","2024-11","2025-02-19 14:51:10","2025-02-19 14:51:10","","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Ethics; Law; eHealth; Collaboration; Systematics; Navigation; Stakeholders; Decision making; Planning; business model; Data systems; Electronic healthcare; ethical; financial; implementation; stakeholder engagement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We did two studies to investigate if compliance could be improved by a poster that reminds health care workers of the regulations. The primary aim of the studies was to measure the effects of a poster's textual (plain, unambiguous written message or pun) and visual features (incongruent or congruent picture) on health care workers' attention to the poster, their attitude towards the poster, their comprehension of the message, and their compliance. Both studies were conducted in a natural setting at a care organization. In total, 193 health care workers participated. The results of the first study showed that a poster with a plain written message and a congruent picture has the most favorable effects on compliance. The results of the second study showed no differences between a poster with a pun and with one with an explicit message; both have favorable effects on compliance.

The design methodology aims at a well-matched system with a maximized power-transfer efficiency for mid-range applications. The system consists of two identical resonant coils driven by high-quality factor loops. The proposed design criteria allows obtaining maximum achievable transfer efficiency and impedance matching at any defined distance without any external matching circuits connected to the driven loops. For validation purposes, a printed WPT system at 10 MHz is fabricated targeting 1-m distance between the transmitting and receiving sides. Its performances in terms of reflection and transmission coefficients, as well as in terms of generated electric and magnetic fields, have been characterized numerically and experimentally. The impact of human body presence on the system has also been investigated observing the splitting in two frequencies of the common resonant frequency of the coils. A dosimetric study has been conducted using a detailed high-resolution anatomical human body model and considering E99, J1 cm2, and specific absorption rate (SAR) (local and whole body averaged SAR) as exposure metrics. It has been observed that peak exposure levels appear in different tissues depending on the body location. Compliance with the international commission on nonionizing radiation protection (ICNIRP) reference level as well as basic restrictions has been studied followed by computing the maximum allowable input power. It has been found that, with the body located 1 m away from the transmitting coil, the maximum allowable input power satisfying E99 is in the order of MW, whereas it reduces to tens of kilowatt when considering SAR and J1 cm2. The latter has been noticed to be the most restrictive dosimetric quantity.","2017-01","2025-02-19 14:51:11","2025-02-19 14:51:11","","270-279","","1","65","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Coils; Design methodology; Dosimetry; exposure assessment; Impedance matching; Magnetic resonance; Microwave theory and techniques; mid-range applications; printed technology; System analysis and design; wireless power transfer (WPT)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fusion Engineering","","","10.1109/FUSION.1993.518484","","Tokamaks and industrial users are faced with the task of maintaining closed-loop, low conductivity, low impurity, cooling water systems. Operating these systems concentrates the impurities in the water requiring subsequent disposal. Environmental regulations are making this increasingly difficult. This paper will discuss the solution to the problem of removing and disposing of copper ions in the DIII-D low conductivity water system. Since the commissioning of the Doublet facility in 1976, the quality of the water in the 3000 gpm system that cools the DIII-D vacuum vessel coils, power supplies and auxiliary heating components has been controlled with mixed-bed ion exchangers. Low ion levels, particularly copper, are required to operate this equipment. In early 1992, the company that leases and regenerates DIII-D ion exchangers said they no longer can accept these resin beds for regeneration due to the level of copper ion an the resin. This change in policy, a change that has been adopted throughout their industry, was necessary to assure that the Metropolitan Sewerage System of the City of San Diego stays in compliance with State of California regulations end EPA-mandated national pre-treatment standards and regulations. A cost effective solution was implemented which utilizes a reverse osmosis filtration system with the ion exchangers for make-up water. Levels of copper ion disposed to the sewer are in compliance with government standards. These measures have thus far proved effective in maintaining low conductivity and overall good quality cooling water. Specifically, this paper discusses DIII-D deionized cooling water quality requirements and an effective means to meet these requirements in order to be in compliance with government regulations for copper ion disposal. The problems discussed, the alternatives considered and the approach taken would be readily applicable to any deionized cooling water system containing copper where EPA standards and regulations are mandated.","1993-10","2025-02-19 14:51:11","2025-02-19 14:51:11","","958-961 vol.2","","","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Government; Coils; Conductivity; Cooling; Copper; Electrical equipment industry; Impurities; Resins; Tokamaks; Vacuum systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The synthesized guidance law addresses a wide range of constraints, with a primary focus on reducing sensitivity to the initial guidance error, resulting in lower required acceleration command at the initial homing phase. Incorporating an input weighting function effectively distributes the guidance command throughout the homing phase. Simultaneously, the guidance law ensures compliance with the terminal impact angle and field-of-view (FOV) constraints. To meet the FOV constraint, the paper integrates a saturation function mapping method. The guidance law ensures that the acceleration command approaches zero at the terminal phase, achieving precise control of the impact angle. Furthermore, the missile’s trajectory generated by this guidance law remains unaffected by variations in missile velocity, enhancing its applicability in real-world scenarios. Numerical simulations are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the synthesized guidance law.","2023-11","2025-02-19 14:51:11","2025-02-19 14:51:11","","328-334","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISSN: 2475-7896","","","","Automation; Trajectory; field-of-view; guidance law; impact angle; Missiles; Numerical simulation; optimal error dynamics; Sensitivity; Shape","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To this end, software engineers must determine which requirements have met or exceeded their legal obligations and which requirements have not. Requirements that have met or exceeded their legal obligations are legally implementation ready, whereas requirements that have not met or exceeded their legal obligations need further refinement. Research is needed to better understand how to support software engineers in making these determinations. In this paper, we describe a case study in which we asked graduate-level software engineering students to assess whether a set of software requirements for an electronic health record system met or exceeded their corresponding legal obligations as expressed in regulations created pursuant to the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). We compare the assessment made by graduate students with an assessment made by HIPAA compliance subject matter experts. Additionally, we contrast these results with those generated by a legal requirements triage algorithm. Our findings suggest that the average graduate-level software engineering student is ill-prepared to write legally compliant software with any confidence and that domain experts are an absolute necessity. Our findings also indicate the potential utility of legal requirements metrics in aiding software engineers as they make legal compliance decisions.","2011-08","2025-02-19 14:51:11","2025-02-19 14:51:11","","207-216","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISSN: 2332-6441","","","","Law; Software systems; legal requirements; Complexity theory; Measurement; requirements metrics; Software engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some product types or focus areas have moved to a more harmonized compliance approach and, with this, the regulations and standards are easier to enforce, simpler for consumers to understand, and more efficient for manufacturers to implement. The uniformity of harmonized regulations results in a less burdensome administrative efforts, fewer labeling requirements, and streamlined conformity assessments. However, the majority of jurisdictions worldwide have not successfully harmonized their requirements and often regulate the same product or component with different requirements. This paper will provide examples of both harmonized and non-harmonized regulations, and the resultant benefits or drawbacks for the consumer, public, economic operators, and government authorities. It will review issues faced by the regulated industry when required to implement non-harmonized regulations, and the effect it has on the products. The paper will provide some suggestions for harmonization of regulations and recommendations for an approach that minimizes administrative burden for both the regulated and regulators, while still allowing environmental standards and regulations to accomplish their intended purpose. Harmonized standards and regulations are effectively and quickly implemented, while maintaining focus on reducing risks and limiting exposures and hazards.","2014-07","2025-02-19 14:51:11","2025-02-19 14:51:11","","73-76","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Monitoring; Energy efficiency; Business; Standards; Europe; Computers; CE Mark; Electrical and electronic equipment; Harmonized legislation; Information and Communications Technology; material restrictions; Materials; RoHS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These technologies generate large amounts of user data that provide opportunities for organisations to improve the quality of their user services. The publication of user-generated data creates risks for exposing an individual’s privacy. In the literature, identity theft and attribute disclosure are the two most common attacks on user-generated data. These privacy issues require data publishing organisations to protect user privacy. International regulatory standards provide consistent frameworks and guidelines that data publishing organisations can use to secure user-sensitive data. This survey discusses the characterisation and quantification of user privacy in compliance with international regulatory standards. We provide an overview of existing regulations and frameworks related to user privacy, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and implications for individuals and businesses. We discuss the steps involved in characterising and quantifying user privacy within the framework of international regulatory standards, privacy tools, and real-world case studies. Furthermore, we share promising directions for future research and development, including advancements in privacy techniques, interdisciplinary collaborations, and the role of emerging technologies. By addressing these challenges and creating a way forward, this work aims to contribute to the ongoing research on user privacy and promote the development of effective strategies for safeguarding user personal data in an increasingly interconnected world.","2024","2025-02-19 14:51:11","2025-02-19 14:51:11","","1-1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Privacy; Security; Protection; Data models; Standards; Social networking (online); Data privacy; Privacy Loss; Privacy Measures; Privacy Quantification; Privacy-Enhancing Techniques; Privacy-Preserving Techniques; Program processors; Surveys; Trust Models; Tutorials","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While conducted noise is well covered in the literature, the radiated noise is not. Regulations about radiated noise impose limits in the noise measured three or ten meters far away the electronic equipment. These measurements are usually made in anechoic rooms, which are a very expensive equipment, and the measurement procedure is not a «plug-and-play» feature, but a carefully protocol of measurement is required. Once the electronic circuit has been tested, in case the regulation was not met, the designer unknowns the source of the problem, so the procedure to make the electronic circuit to comply with the regulation used to be a trial-and-mistake method, when the experience of the designer is essential. A new radiated noise measurement technique is proposed in this paper with two objectives: to simplify the measurement procedure and to have more information about the noise sources. The main idea is to scan the electric/field at two arbitrary but known distances. From these measurements, the Source Reconstruction Technique (SRT) allows the identification of the noise sources in the surface of the circuit and the field estimation at any distance, so that the regulation compliance can be evaluated. Moreover, if the regulation is not satisfied, the effect of the noise source modification can be tested, to find how the circuit must be modified to comply with the regulation.","2007-06","2025-02-19 14:51:11","2025-02-19 14:51:11","","2544-2549","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISSN: 2163-5145","","","","Electronic equipment; Circuit noise; Circuit testing; Electromagnetic interference; Electronic circuits; Electronic equipment testing; Noise measurement; Power electronics; Protocols; Surface reconstruction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper a new firmware module is proposed, that will ensure that devices, in all circumstances will comply with the ETSI regulations for single channel emissions in the 868MHz ISM band. Namely, assuring compliance with the duty-cycle limit, the maximum Tx time and minimum Tx-off time limit. Such a solution has not been researched mostly due to the popularity of the virtually world-wide 2.4 GHz ISM band which at present does not impose duty-cycle limitations. The wireless sensor networks (WSNs) operating in the 868MHz band have their own niche applications that benefit from the increased signal range. The development and the acceptance of such applications will benefit from the existence of the proposed module implemented in firmware/software. We propose such a solution and demonstrate its implementation on a custom developed node and protocol. Implementation with IEEE 802.15.4 standard is discussed as well.

This paper focuses on the practical implementation of EV hosting capacity regulations in various political and social contexts. There is a growing body of literature on EV hosting capacities informed by load flow simulations; these studies typically define the EV hosting capacity as the percentage of households that can install an EV charger before the grid becomes constrained. However, little attention has been given to the practical implementation of these hosting capacities. The way in which EV hosting capacities are defined and enforced has a major impact on both the uptake of EVs as well as the potential to overwhelm grid infrastructure. There are a range of legal mechanisms to implement EV hosting capacities, and these can range from “hard laws” that limit EV charger capacities through legally binding instruments to “soft laws” that utilize tariff-based incentives to shift EV loads to times when the grid has available capacity. Our hypothesis is that a range of factors should influence the design of locally appropriate EV regulation. These criteria may include the history of regulatory compliance in that customer segment, the technical capacity of the grid operator, and the urgency of implementation. The contribution of this paper is to initiate the development of a decision framework to guide the policymakers design locally appropriate EV hosting capacity regulations. The eventual decision framework will be of relevance to network planners and policymakers that are developing regulations to manage the uptake of EVs on their networks.","2022-06","2025-02-19 14:51:11","2025-02-19 14:51:11","","611-615","","","2022","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The encoding reduces ambiguity by making relations between requirements statements explicit. These relations include refinement, pre- and post-conditions, and exceptions that shape the environment in which the developer's system must operate and limiting the behavior of the system to a set of mandatory and discretionary actions.

The authors discuss the economic issues behind making this choice and present a cybersecurity economics model for public policy in the presence of strategic attackers. They calibrated these models in the field with the support of National Grid, which operates in the UK and on the US East Coast. The model shows that optimal choices are subject to phase transitions: depending on the combination of incentives, operators will stop investing in risk assessment and only care about compliance (and vice versa).

Universities offer Internet services to users, store personal information of learners, staff, conference and attendees. which exposes them to potential risks and legal liabilities. Failure to ensure compliance with information security laws poses significant financial and reputation risk and may invite serious scrutiny of university activities by law enforcement bodies [24]. While universities have sought various measures to achieve compliance (e.g. self-regulations, security policies, staff/student handbooks, public relation campaigns, Web and email reminders and audits.), these have had limited success in influencing user behaviours. The rate of electronic abuse and lack of compliance with policies is simply on the rise. The August 2009 EDUCAUSE Review indicates that security remains one of the top strategic issues facing higher education institutions [2]. [20] claims that half of all personal identity breaches occur in higher education. The recording industry and motion picture associations are increasingly holding institutions liable for illegal downloading of copyright materials [11] and students have also been accused of privacy violations [8]. So, what makes compliance with policies and regulations in universities difficult and how can compliance be measured and achieved effectively? This study examines the factors that influence compliance with security policies and regulations in universities.

Benford's law is an empirical law that describes the distribution of first digits in series of numbers in natural phenomena. We claim that Benford's law describes the inter-arrival time of UDP packets and flows in normal traffic of networks. As a result, any significant anomaly in UDP packets and flows including deliberate intrusions, unwanted errors or in general, network failures, can be identified by checking the first digit distribution inter-arrival time of UDP packets and flows. In a recent work, the relationship between Weibull distribution and Benford's law was studied. In another work, the compliance of the inter-arrival time of UDP packets and flows from Weibull distribution is presented.

Besides the more controversial issue of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and its effects on U.S. Sovereignty and trade policies, GATT has also required brand new laws, rules, and regulations for patents. On June 8, 1995, these new developments in patent law went into effect.

Whole new policies and approaches to obtaining patent protection for inventions are now required to meet the challenges of the new patent laws.

For those facilities using alternative fuels and possibly raw materials, past practices will also require altering to address the non-hazardous secondary material (NHSM) and Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration (CISWI) rules. Meanwhile, there is continued work by the industry and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to decipher and clarify final implementation steps of each rule and, in particular, to address the question of “what is a waste,” which drives facility implementation strategies. The Portland cement industry has a long and proven track record in historically implementing the PC MACT rules and in using alternative fuels and raw materials (AFR) for a variety of environmentally and economically beneficial reasons. As the final compliance steps are put in place, there are continuing questions on how the new rules will be successfully implemented, while optimizing plant operations and continuing to grow the important AFR programs. Given that this suite of regulations will forever change the playing field on day-to-day operations, and the historic use of AFR in cement plants in the U.S., there will be critical compliance and financial risk implications on how to best manage final decisions.

Among the multitude of applications in this space, legal document classification emerges as a pivotal yet complex undertaking. Legal texts, characterized by unique domain-centric semantics and intricate linguistic patterns, necessitate precision-driven classification systems for numerous practical implications. This paper illuminates the challenges and opportunities in automating the classification of European Union (EU) legal documents, emphasizing the interrelationships among statutes and the hierarchical nature of legal references. In this context, we introduce a novel graph data modeling technique that adeptly marries content-centric indicators with the relational dynamics inherent among diverse legal documents. Central to our approach is a framework that melds text embeddings with graph neural networks for the classification of legal documents aligned with their subject-based directories. Empirical evaluations on the EU law dataset underline the efficacy of our model across varying granularities, from general thematic categories to intricate subtopics.

The existing telephone call recording processes using manual logbook entries or a recording system without verification and auditing capabilities are labour-intensive and prone to human error. This study is motivated to address this real-world problem by designing a system that streamlines telephone call audit processes. This can be verified with digital technologies to meet security requirements as well as legal requirements stipulated by the Australian National Electricity Rules. In meeting security and legal compliance requirements of the Australian National Electricity Rules, this study develops a novel approach using the Clark-Wilson Integrity Model and blockchain technology for an automatic telephone call audit system with security provisions to prevent unauthorized access to and manipulation of telephone call records nationally. Although the application of blockchain has generated great interest in other areas, few studies have been conducted on its application to auditing. This study uses the Clark-Wilson Integrity Model to verify metadata records’ integrity at the systems where metadata are generated. The proposed architectural design not only enhances data integrity and confidentiality but also enables the automatic execution of telephone call audit processes for auditors. The auditing system we propose presents a higher level of security compared to the existing system.","2021","2025-02-19 14:51:24","2025-02-19 14:51:24","","146437-146453","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Law; blockchain; compliance; security; Audit; Security; Generators; Telephone sets; Regulators; Blockchains; Metadata","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Identity management is a security feature that enables users to manage and utilize their digital identities when interacting with online services. A self-sovereign identity (SSI) system is a cutting-edge identity model that uses blockchain technology to foster peer-to-peer trust in service authentication and authorization. SSI systems typically adhere to a set of functional- and quality-related principles and properties. However, we discovered that the current information security and privacy principles and properties of SSI systems are not compliant with the laws, regulations, and technical standards. A compliance set of principles and properties must be established to support the implementation of SSI systems and to improve security and privacy. In this article, we propose CSSPS, a new compliance SSI system property set that expands upon the missing security and privacy controls specified in applicable laws, regulations, and technical standards. We used systematic comparative analysis and systematic review to identify inconsistent content from a vast collection of applicable sources, and then used them to extend the current properties of the SSI system. The proposed CSSPS increases the consistency of security and privacy controls, and is applicable in accordance with the functionality of real SSI systems, as determined by a qualitative evaluation. The proposed CSSPS contributes to SSI system implementation by facilitating correct implementation, while adhering to applicable information security and privacy sources. In addition, the proposed CSSPS can indirectly enhance the security and privacy of SSI systems.","2022","2025-02-19 14:51:24","2025-02-19 14:51:24","","99370-99393","","","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Privacy; Regulation; Security; Information security; Blockchains; Identity management systems; Information security and privacy; legislative compliance; self-sovereign identity; standard compliance; system property","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, little attention has been paid to the challenge of coping with variability characterizing the legal domain (e.g., multiple ways to comply with a given law, frequent updates to regulations, different jurisdictions, etc.) on the design of software systems. This position paper advocates the use of adaptation mechanisms in order to support regulatory compliance for software systems. First we show an example of how Zanshin, a requirements-based adaptation framework, can be used to design a system that adapts to legal requirements to accommodate legal variability. Then we examine how legal texts can be analyzed as sources for parameters and indicators needed to support adaptation. As motivating running example we consider legal situations concerning the Google driverless car and its recent legalization in the highways of Nevada and soon also in California.","2013-05","2025-02-19 14:51:24","2025-02-19 14:51:24","","163-168","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISSN: 2157-2321","","","","Requirements engineering; Law; Regulatory compliance; Adaptation models; Software systems; Adaptation framework; Adaptive systems; Legal variability; Vehicles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These advances, however, can come with great cost to society when they fail to comply with government laws and regulations. While compliance failures do result from technical missteps in design, there is also a wide gap between the technical expertise and culture of legal analysts and software engineers, as well as competing priorities between legal requirements and business objectives. In this perspective paper, we propose changing legal compliance from a corporate oversight activity to a principal design activity, wherein lawyers and software engineers employ enhanced methods and tools tailored to bridge the cultural and knowledge gap and assess legal and business trade-offs. To that end, we describe a new software quality, called Legal Accountability, which can be evaluated alongside other qualities, such as usability, modifiability, performance and testing. Legal Accountability has five properties that lawyers and designers must attend to, including legal traceability, completeness, validity, auditability and continuity. We illustrate the quality with examples from the U.S. data processing perspective, and prior work in requirements engineering, before concluding with future and ongoing research challenges.","2022-08","2025-02-19 14:51:24","2025-02-19 14:51:24","","101-113","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISSN: 2332-6441","","","","Requirements engineering; Law; compliance; regulations; law; Software quality; Data processing; Usability; Technological innovation; Cultural differences; software quality","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Several documents are produced during the process such as Term of Reference, Contract of Supplier, and Term of Closing the Contract. The documents produced during the IT procurement process must comply with the legal requirements defined in IN 04/2014, as well as being aligned with the IT necessities described in the IT Master Plan and the Strategic Institutional Plan. This paper presents an approach to answer the research question: “how we can guarantee that planning of procurement for IT solutions realized by Brazilian federal public organizations complies legally with the IN 04/2014?” The approach supports legal compliance verification through traceability links between legal requirements of IN 04/2014, procurement planning documents, and institutional planning documents (Strategic Institutional Plan and IT Master Plan). The approach is detailed through an example and the its main contributions are: (i) reduces manual work necessary to verification of legal compliance within the set of documents produced; (ii) supports in auditing and control of contracting of IT solutions in Brazil's federal public administrative sphere; (iii) gives incentive to good IT governance and transparency of information.","2016-09","2025-02-19 14:51:24","2025-02-19 14:51:24","","229-238","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Law; legal compliance; Information technology; Contracts; Planning; Procurement; legal requirement traceability; planning procurement for IT; Syntactics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The global, decentralized nature of cloud computing presents numerous issues that we are just now grappling with in our endeavors to protect privacy rights, meet compliance demands, and maintain a secure computing environment. This chapter covers effective risk management, risk metrics, and strategies for an effective risk management program. Policies are one of the foundational elements of a governance and risk management program. They guide the organization, based on standards and guidelines. Policies ensure that the organization is operating within its risk profile. Policies actually define, or are the expression of, the organization's risk tolerance. Cloud computing as it exists today has commoditized compute, storage and networking services. Enterprise risk management has shifted in response to this change. It is vitally important that both the customer and the provider focus on risk management and the challenges presented with cloud computing. The cloud customer (in the role of data owner) is ultimately responsible for ensuring control effectiveness, but stored data, security, and risk management require a partnership between the customer and provider.","2020","2025-02-19 14:51:24","2025-02-19 14:51:24","","269-293","","","","","","","","","","","Wiley","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1002/9781119603351.ch11","","","","Cloud computing; Law; Risk management; Organizations; Standards organizations; Stakeholders; Regulators","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The open government datasets to be mashed-up by developers may be subject to distinct licenses, legal notices, terms of use, and applicable law and regulations from multiple jurisdictions. Within this complex ecosystem there is a need to create semi-automatic tools supported by an ontology to help technical reusers of Public Sector Information to utilize datasets according to their intended purpose and in compliance with the legal obligations that govern the rights to reuse the data. Unfortunately, some researchers may avoid considering all the legal frameworks that apply in the domain of Open Government Data and limit their investigation to only the area of licenses. To enable wider, compliant utilisation of mashed-up open data, we have analysed the European Union (EU) legal framework of reuse of Public Sector Information (PSI), the EU Database Directive and copyright framework and other legal sources (e.g., licenses, legal notices, terms of use) that can apply to open government Datasets. From this deep analysis we now model several major concepts in an Ontology of Open Government Data Licenses Framework for a Mash-up Model (OGDL4M). There have been earlier ontologies for creative commons or open licenses, but they did not anticipate the other legal constraints that arise from Open Government regulations. The OGDL4M ontology will be used for qualifying datasets in order to improve the accuracy of their legal annotation. The Ontology also aims to connect each applicable legal rule to official legal texts in order to direct legal experts and reusers to primary sources. This paper aims to present the modules of the OGDL4M ontology in depth and to describe some preliminary evaluation.","2017-05","2025-02-19 14:51:24","2025-02-19 14:51:24","","113-124","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Law; legal ontology; Ontologies; Government; Databases; Terminology; Licenses; licensing of open government data; open government data mash-up","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although these technologies may provide great benefits, they can equally threaten the privacy of building occupants and raise data security concerns.Aim. The complexity of smart buildings poses difficulties when applying the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) in addressing the aforementioned concerns. This paper unpacks the specific ambiguities that make applying the GDPR in this context challenging and identify the key requirements for data controllers in managing data privacy. Methods. This paper takes on a doctrinal approach to research by drawing upon legal sources and existing scholarship in related fields, in particular, legal privacy scholars. Results. The pressing compliance problems stem from the debate on what is considered as 'personal data' in smart buildings in which dictates the compliance requirements, in particular, data protection impact assessments (DPIAs). We identify three facets that smart building controllers should focus on in complying with the GDPR: establishing personal data, identifying individual rights, and determining a high risk to the rights and freedom of natural persons. Conclusions. The law can help prevent harms and ensure that individual rights are protected in smart buildings. To achieve this, understanding the compliance pain points of smart environment in order to strike the balance between the privacy of the occupants and the benefits of smart buildings is crucial. This is a call for further empirical and interdisciplinary research to effectively address the issues surrounding smart environment compliance challenges.","2023-07","2025-02-19 14:51:24","2025-02-19 14:51:24","","619-626","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISSN: 2768-0657","","","","Compliance; Law; Privacy; privacy; Data Protection; Security; Organizations; Force measurement; Data security; Position measurement; Smart buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to obtain low output voltages with a high efficiency, synchronous rectification is mandatory. When the output voltage is low, it is very difficult to use self-driven synchronous rectification and additional windings are used to properly drive the metal oxide semiconductor field effect transmitters (MOSFETs). Besides this, IEC 1000-3-2 regulations impose low input current harmonic contents for power levels higher than 75 W. In this paper, a recently proposed synchronous rectification scheme is combined with a modified input current shaper to design a 100 W, 3.3 V AC/DC converter that complies with IEC 1000-3-2 regulations. The efficiency obtained in the prototype was very high for this application (86%) and both the size increase and the cost increase were quite low in comparison with the original topology with no synchronous rectification and no IEC 1000-3-2 compliance.","2003-07","2025-02-19 14:51:25","2025-02-19 14:51:25","","966-974","","4","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Costs; IEC standards; Circuit topology; DC-DC power converters; Low voltage; MOSFETs; Power factor correction; Power supplies; Rectifiers; Windings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This problem has been discussed in this study under three viewpoints: i) the marine engine efficiency, ii) the decision-making process for selecting the technologies for reducing air emissions from shipping and iii) the challenges in the shipping industry during the era of digitalization. In the section of the marine engine efficiency, the fundamental laws of thermodynamics in relation to a Carnot cycle/heat engine have been illustrated to show the maximum efficiency that an engine can achieve within its operational temperature range. In the section of the decision-making process, the selection of technologies for reducing emissions from shipping, a variety of possible options has been discussed: e.g. using compliant fuels with low sulphur content in the current machinery; integrating an emission abatement technology such as marine scrubber as an after-treatment device; opting for alternative fuels such as Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) or Methanol and future ship propulsion with an array of alternatives. Nevertheless, it can be a challenge for decision-makers (shipowners and operators) to select the most suitable alternatives for regulatory compliance in reducing emissions from shipping. It involves with multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) in which a number of alternative options are assessed with regard to multiple factors and sub-factors as described in this study.

We have developed semantically rich approach to automate the analysis of legal documents and have implemented a system to capture various facts and rules contributing towards building an efficient legal knowledge base that contains details of the relationships between various legal elements, semantically similar terminologies, deontic expressions and cross-referenced legal facts and rules. In this paper, we describe our framework along with the results of automating knowledge extraction from the FARS document (Title 48, CFR). Our approach can be used by Big Data Users to automate knowledge extraction from Large Legal documents.","2017-12","2025-02-19 14:51:25","2025-02-19 14:51:25","","3596-3603","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Law; Big Data; NLP; Ontologies; Government; Deep Learning; Code of Federal Regulations; IEEE Sections; Information Retrieval; Knowledge based systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The analysis and interpretation of standards and regulations requires considerable skills and consumes significant effort in product development. Therefore initiating reuse from the analysis and elicitation of requirements from standards and regulations may provide promising potential for gaining efficiency in development and also for assuring sufficient quality of the work. In this paper, a method to manage requirements from standards, by establishing a reusable requirements catalogue, is suggested and a metamodel illustrating the information needed for tractability between derived requirements and legal texts, needed to facilitate reuse, is demonstrated. The paper presents a case study, where reusable requirements covering secondary packaging for medical injection devices were established, using a spreadsheet layout to capture and document the information presented in the metamodel.","2016-09","2025-02-19 14:51:25","2025-02-19 14:51:25","","220-228","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Requirements engineering; Law; Regulatory compliance; Standards; Conferences; Layout; Medical device development; Product design; Requirements reuse","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

[Question/ problem]: However, interpreting regulations still largely depends on individual legal expertise and experience within the respective domain, with little to no systematic methodologies and supportive tools to guide this practice. In fact, research in this area is too often detached from practitioners' experiences, rendering the proposed solutions not transferable to industrial practice. As we argue, one reason is that we still lack a profound understanding of industry- and domain-specific practices and challenges. [Principal ideas/ results]: We aim to close this gap and provide such an investigation at the example of the banking and insurance domain. We conduct an industrial multi-case study as part of a long-term academia-industry collaboration with a mediumsized software development and renovation company. We explore contemporary industrial practices and challenges when inferring requirements from regulations to support more problem-driven research. Our study investigates the complexities of requirement engineering in regulatory contexts, pinpointing various issues and discussing them in detail. We highlight the gathered insights and the practical challenges encountered and suggest avenues for future research. [Contribution]: Our contribution is a comprehensive case study focused on the FinTech domain, offering a detailed understanding of the specific needs within this sector.

This paper provides an overview of the significant growth and importance of the aquaculture industry, its challenges, and its impacts on the environment. It highlights the need for regulations and monitoring to ensure sustainable practices in aquaculture. In the European Union (EU), various regulations have been developed to regulate the mariculture industry, including the Aquaculture Regulation and the Common Fisheries Policy. Regulatory frameworks and standards have been introduced to address environmental impacts and protect the industry's long-term viability while safeguarding the environment. These regulations aim to achieve sustainable production, food safety, and quality, animal health, integrated coastal zone management, etc. The EU periodically reviews and updates its regulations based on scientific findings, technological advancements, and changing market dynamics. Compliance with regulations is essential for the profitability of mariculture operations. Identification of aspects for improvement in the EU regulations for mariculture production is given. These include improving regulatory clarity, harmonizing regulations of the states, and simplifying regulatory procedures. The paper also discusses the efforts of the European Union and member states to address environmental concerns and the need for an energy transition in the fisheries and aquaculture sectors. An overview of responsible authorities in Croatia related to environmental protection and highlights of national and EU regulations governing maritime protection are provided. Limitations in the regulatory framework and alternatives for addressing energy efficiency and reducing the carbon footprint in aquaculture are discussed.

OTASU provide huge benefits in terms of user experience, security, and efficiency. However, due to involved risks, safety and security mechanisms and new regulations are needed for their adoption in the critical domain. The automotive industry is already in the race to adopt safe and secure OTASU, as by 2024, compliance to new UN regulations will become compulsory. However, the standards providing the specifications and requirements for OTASU are still in their infancy. Many other dependable system domains, that are now more digital and connected than ever, are following same trends towards OTASU. For instance, OTASU are very likely to be adopted in the railway domain in a near future, as the ability of remotely updating railway equipment considerably reduces maintenance costs and time, improving system availability. This paper describes how the UP2DATE framework adheres to existing and emerging regulations and standards and evaluates them through a railway case-study. Obtained results demonstrate that the proposed updating framework can provide great savings in the installation and maintenance phases of railway signalling devices by reducing the time required for the update and by removing the need for operator presence on-site.","2023-09","2025-02-19 14:51:25","2025-02-19 14:51:25","","399-406","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISSN: 2771-2508","","","","Regulation; regulations; standards; Software; Maintenance engineering; cybersecurity; functional safety; Market research; patching; Rail transportation; Software updates; User experience; Wireless networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The 1998 Track Safety Standards and 1999 Passenger Equipment Safety Standards provide comprehensive requirements for the qualification and operation of passenger equipment. Among many safety issues, these standards address the response of rolling stock at speed to track deviations, and the potential for derailment and/or injury to passengers. The principles contained in the Safety Standards are also used by FRA to evaluate safety performance of vehicles for operation at high cant deficiency for speeds less than 90 mph as part of FRA's waiver process. This paper describes the types of static and dynamic tests and equipment that are required with respect to vehicle-track interaction to demonstrate compliance of new equipment with the Standards, and the technical fundamentals behind the requirements. Examples include the National Railroad Passenger Corporation's (Amtrak's) experiences in applying for waivers and qualifying new equipment under these regulations, particularly the high cant deficiency testing of the Talgo train in the Pacific Northwest, and the high-speed and high cant deficiency testing of Maryland Rail Commuter's (MARC's) MARC-III bi-level cars, Acela Express trainsets and Amtrak's high-horsepower electric locomotives in the Northeast Corridor.

As a response, this paper presents guidelines to support the education sector in this regard. What underpins this work is the knowledge gained from a comprehensive examination of the current state of cybersecurity practices in Jordanian schools. Then, combining case studies, insight from expert consultations, and a review of Jordanian cybercrime legislation informed the guidelines on how schools should approach effective cybersecurity policy and implementation. The findings combine essential elements which span strategy, standards, hardware and software, and training. A core theme of these guidelines is how legal compliance can be achieved for school policies in relation to Jordanian Cybercrime Law and the negative effects of non-compliance. These outcomes have ramifications for school administrators and policymakers to acknowledge the urgent need to integrate legal and educational strategies to strengthen their cybersecurity practices. The intent of this recommended framework is for Jordanian schools to strike a balance complying with national cybercrime laws and fostering a secure educational environment. This proactive approach has a dual purpose. Institutions can be protected from cyber threats and in doing so promoting a culture of cybersecurity awareness among students and staff. However, this framework relies on administrators and policymakers to navigate the complexities of digital security in educational environments.","2024-12","2025-02-19 14:51:25","2025-02-19 14:51:25","","1-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISSN: 2831-4948","","","","Law; Training; Software; Legislation; Standards; Reviews; Guidelines; Computer crime; Best practices; component; formatting; insert; Resilience; style; styling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Requirements that have met or exceeded their legal obligations are legally implementation ready, whereas requirements that have not met or exceeded their legal obligations need further refinement. In this paper, we examine how software engineers make these determinations using a multi-case study with three cases. Each case involves assessment of requirements for an electronic health record system that must comply with the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and is measured against the evaluations of HIPAA compliance subject matter experts. Our first case examines how individual graduate-level software engineering students assess whether the requirements met or exceeded their HIPAA obligations. Our second case replicates the findings from our first case using a different set of participants. Our third case examines how graduate-level software engineering students assess requirements using the Wideband Delphi approach to deriving consensus in groups.

However, little has been explored about the legal challenges that can be directly linked to the use of AI systems in sports. This phenomenon must be framed within a legal framework in great turmoil, which has led national and supranational institutions to review privacy legislation in recent years and to attempt the first regulatory approaches in the field of AI. In particular, the EU is intervening heavily in these areas: the approval of the GDPR, which came into force in 2018, completely reformed the regulations on the protection of personal data; much more recently, in 2021, the European Commission published a proposal for a Regulation on AI (hereinafter, AI Act). Legal reflection on these issues is still in progress, but it is in an even more embryonic phase if we think about the impact of AI on the sporting phenomenon. In this context, we need to ask ourselves whether the current regulatory framework will hold up against the increasingly widespread and disparate uses of AI systems in the field of sport. In particular, compliance with the principles established by the GDPR must be assessed during all phases of the AI system's lifecycle. In this regard, there are problems relating to the accuracy of the data, the prevention and rectification of potential bias, the consent of the interested party, the principle of data minimization with respect to the purpose of the data processing, profiling and automated decision-making (Article 22). On the other hand, the uses of AI in the field of sport must be correctly framed in the regulatory framework proposed by the AI Act, with which the Commission has opted for a risk-based classification of AI systems (high, low and minimum), providing for different regimes of obligations and rights for the AI actors. The research aims to improve the advancement of knowledge for institutions, companies, associations, athletes and operators in the world of sport. In the European context, they are increasingly confronted with the use of AI systems which, on the one hand, have undoubted advantages for the improvement of sports performance, but on the other hand risk jeopardizing potential breaches of the fundamental rights of the people involved. The conclusions of the paper will try to trace the correct balance, from a juridical point of view, between the different needs and rights at stake, highlighting the strengths and criticalities of the current European regulatory framework, already in force or still in progress.","2022-07","2025-02-19 14:51:25","2025-02-19 14:51:25","","100-105","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GDPR; Law; artificial intelligence; Regulation; AI Act; Force; Europe; Minimization; AI for sport; Reflection; sports law; Stars","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

AI-based products detect risks and secure systems and data. Cybercriminals can use technology to launch more sophisticated attacks. AI-based security is in demand due to cyberattacks. With the adoption of AI technology, GDPR requires most countries to have legal measures to protect their citizens' data and privacy. Data protection and privacy issues arise when using AI technology. AI use must comply with GDPR, including obtaining consent for data processing, ensuring data accuracy, and giving individuals the right to access, correct, or delete their data. Organisations must also be transparent about how their AI makes decisions and not discriminate against individuals or groups. This study examines Malaysia's GDPR compliance on AI usage, data protection, and privacy in light of current concerns. This study analyses primary and secondary sources using doctrinal research. In 2022, Malaysia's banking, healthcare, and telecommunications sectors were hit by data breaches, indicating that AI is increasing data breaches. Thus, the government must examine citizen data protection and privacy concerns and re-examine its governance, including legal and regulatory mechanisms, to see if it conforms to international norms and consider reforms.","2023-05","2025-02-19 14:51:25","2025-02-19 14:51:25","","284-288","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Data protection; Ethics; GDPR; Law; Privacy; Data breach; Data Protection; Artificial Intelligence; Medical services; Malaysia; Pandemics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is also described as specifying “who gets to do what on which resources.” IAM is the recommended way to control access in most cases. In some limited cases, such as in a development environment, the older primitive roles system may be used. An identity is an entity that represents a person or other agent that performs actions on a GCP resource. Identities are sometimes called members. Google accounts are used by people and represent people who interact with GCP, such as developers and administrators. These accounts are designated by an email address that is linked to a Google account. For example, jane.doe@gmail.com could be an identity in GCP. The domain of the email does not have to be gmail.com; it just has to be associated with a Google account. Service accounts are used by applications running in GCP. These are used to give applications their own set of access controls instead of relying on using a person's account for permissions.

The pervasiveness of computers with the advancement of network infrastructures, systems, and applications makes gathering, interpreting, and propagating personal information more streamlined. Therefore, in the UK, strict adherence to the law is inevitable. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is one of the EU’s most comprehensive legislative proposals. It is being developed to centralize the data protection law across the EU and help users and data subjects control their data better. Businesses are facing heavy penalties in the form of fines for non-compliance to this recent act - facing heights of 20 million euros (or 4% of their global turnover). This paper focuses on the key challenges and solutions to Data Privacy in the modern world with an enhanced focus on IIoT as an ideal application domain due to its rising innovations in the contemporary world. We propose a Methodology for analyzing Data Privacy incidents to optimize organizational GDPR compliance and aid through operational organization adoption to cybersecurity professionals and decision-makers. Furthermore, to make proficient updates and upgrades to their methods of handling data and ensure Data Privacy for their respective stakeholders aiming to protect and defend the business from financial loss, reputational damage, and stakeholder damage.","2022-09","2025-02-19 14:51:25","2025-02-19 14:51:25","","86-94","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cybersecurity; Law; Big Data; Data Privacy; Information Security; Information security; Organizations; Systematics; Data privacy; Access Control; Technological innovation; Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Human Rights Watch (HRW) is a prominent campaigner against Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS) and has expressed concern these systems are fundamentally at odds with the international humanitarian law (IHL) framework for armed conflict. This framework places human control over the use of lethal force at the very heart of the targeting process. HRW asserts that the ceding of human control to AI-enabled capabilities may undermine and gradually erode the IHL framework, leaving the battlespace legally ungoverned and civilians unprotected. Concerns about the military use of AI have been exacerbated by the actions and narratives of some nations that are perceived as competing in an Al arms race. However, the debate about AI has been clouded by the fact that it focuses excessively on LAWS and human control. As a result, very little consideration is given to other potentially positive uses of AI technology in targeting. These include AI's role in Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance and Information Operations. This paper seeks to present a more nuanced examination of the role of AI in kinetic targeting and how it may affect compliance with IHL. The legal, ethical and technical arguments against and in favour of the use of AI will be examined. Finally, a way forward on this complex and emotive issue is proposed that offers a means to reinforce IHL whilst accepting that advances in technology will continue.","2021-05","2025-02-19 14:51:25","2025-02-19 14:51:25","","43-57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISSN: 2325-5374","","","","Law; artificial intelligence; Force; Process control; Surveillance; Reconnaissance; armed conflict; Heart; international humanitarian law; targeting; Weapons","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Performance and resource consumption must be considered while creating such systems. Amdahl's law argues that the proportion of the workload that cannot be parallelized limits a system's speedup. This law affects system design in decentralized cluster data warehousing. In creating a decentralized cluster data warehouse, Amdahl's law requires detecting and evaluating bottlenecks in data input, storage, processing, and query execution. Designers may improve parallelizable components by understanding non-parallelizable components. A decentralized cluster data warehouse needs data propagation. Keeping frequently accessible data close may impair system performance. This requires exact data partition, replication, and cluster node data placement. Decentralized cluster data warehouses need technical, organizational, and governance concerns. Data security, privacy, regulatory compliance, and accessibility are examples. John Gustafson and Edwin Barsis' Gustafson's Law stresses parallel computing's scalability and workload rise. Gustafson's Law allows scaling up the issue and using more computer resources to handle higher workloads, unlike Amdahl's Law. The law shows that as the issue size increases, the percentage of the program that may be processed in parallel becomes a bigger fraction of the entire execution time, improving efficiency and speedup. Gustafson's Law promotes reducing execution time by dividing task over numerous processors. This abstract compares Gustafson's Law with Amdahl's Law, revealing parallel computing's advantages for bigger problem instances and the impact of increasing workload in parallel efficiency.","2023-10","2025-02-19 14:51:25","2025-02-19 14:51:25","","343-348","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ISSN: 2768-0673","","","","Organizations; Costs; Computer architecture; Scalability; Amdahl's law; Data; Data warehouses; Decentralized cluster data warehouses; dissemination; Gustafson's Law; Systems architecture; Warehousing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
