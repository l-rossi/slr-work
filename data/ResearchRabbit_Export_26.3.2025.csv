Antón","Addressing Legal Requirements in Requirements Engineering","","","","10.1109/re.2007.65","","Legal texts, such as regulations and legislation, are playing an increasingly important role in requirements engineering and system development. Monitoring systems for requirements and policy compliance has been recognized in the requirements engineering community as a key area for research. Similarly, regulatory compliance is critical in systems that are governed by regulations and law, especially given that non-compliance can result in both financial and criminal penalties. Working with legal texts can be very challenging, however, because they contain numerous ambiguities, cross-references, domain-specific definitions, and acronyms, and are frequently amended via new regulations and case law. Requirements engineers and compliance auditors must be able to identify relevant regulations, extract requirements and other key concepts, and monitor compliance throughout the software lifecycle. This paper surveys research efforts over the past 50 years in handling legal texts for systems development. These efforts include the use of symbolic logic, logic programming, first-order temporal logic, deontic logic, defeasible logic, goal modeling, and semi-structured representations. This survey can aid requirements engineers and auditors to better specify, monitor, and test software systems for compliance.","2007","2025-03-26 12:56:38","2025-03-26 12:56:38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/re.2007.65","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result, organizations must take a systematic approach to ensure that their business processes comply with these regulations. In the past, we introduced a requirements framework that mapped regulations documents and goals to goal and scenario models of organizational processes. The intent was to help organizations document and manage the compliance of their processes in the face of evolutionary changes. In this paper, we extend our framework by incorporating regulation scenario models and by adding the notion of contribution link level to the compliance link types. These extensions result in a frame-work that is more aligned to the needs of an organization when it must evaluate and ensure the legal compliance of its organizational processes.","2009","2025-03-26 12:56:38","2025-03-26 12:56:38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/re.2009.42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In response, requirements engineers must specify compliant system requirements to satisfy applicable legal security and privacy obligations. Specifying legally compliant requirements is challenging because legal texts are complex and ambiguous by nature. In this paper, we discuss our evaluation of the requirements for iTrust, an open-source Electronic Health Records system, for compliance with legal requirements governing security and privacy in the healthcare domain. We begin with an overview of the method we developed, using existing requirements engineering techniques, and then summarize our experiences in applying our method to the iTrust system. We illustrate some of the challenges that practitioners face when specifying requirements for a system that must comply with law and close with a discussion of needed future research focusing on security and privacy requirements.","2010","2025-03-26 12:56:39","2025-03-26 12:56:39","","","","","","","Requirements Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-009-0089-5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To ensure compliance under the law, the security and privacy requirements of relevant software systems must properly be aligned with these regulations. However, these regulations describe stakeholder rules, called rights and obligations, in complex and sometimes ambiguous legal language. These ""rules"" are often precursors to software requirements that must undergo considerable refinement and analysis before they become implementable. To support the software engineering effort to derive security requirements from regulations, we present a methodology for directly extracting access rights and obligations from regulation texts. The methodology provides statement-level coverage for an entire regulatory document to consistently identify and infer six types of data access constraints, handle complex cross references, resolve ambiguities, and assign required priorities between access rights and obligations to avoid unlawful information disclosures. We present results from applying this methodology to the entire regulation text of the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule.","2008","2025-03-26 12:56:39","2025-03-26 12:56:39","","","","","","","IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/tse.2007.70746","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The structure and syntax of regulations affects how well software engineers identify and interpret legal requirements. Inconsistent interpretations can lead to noncompliance and violations of the law. To support software engineers who must comply with these regulations, I propose a Frame-Based Requirements Analysis Method (FBRAM) to acquire and specify legal requirements from U.S. federal regulatory documents. The legal requirements are systematically specified using a reusable, domain-independent upper ontology, natural language phrase heuristics, a regulatory document model and a frame-based markup language. The methodology maintains traceability from regulatory statements and phrases to formal properties in a frame-based model and supports the resolution of multiple types of legal ambiguity. The methodology is supported by a software prototype to assist engineers with applying the model and with analyzing legal requirements. This work is validated in three domains, information privacy, information accessibility and aviation safety, which are governed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998, and the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, respectively.","2009","2025-03-26 12:56:39","2025-03-26 12:56:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Legal%20requirements%20acquisition%20for%20the%20specification%20of%20legally%20compliant%20information%20systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such rules must be respected by software used in these sectors. The regulatory statements are somewhat informal and must be interpreted carefully in the software interface to private data. This paper describes techniques to formalize regulatory privacy rules and how to exploit this formalization to analyze the rules automatically. Our formalism, which we call privacy APIs, is an extension of access control matrix operations to include (1) operations for notification and logging and (2) constructs that ease the mapping between legal and formal language. We validate the expressive power of privacy APIs by encoding the 2000 and 2003 HIPAA consent rules in our system. This formalization is then encoded into Promela and we validate the usefulness of the formalism by using the SPIN model checker to verify properties that distinguish the two versions of HIPAA.","2006","2025-03-26 12:56:39","2025-03-26 12:56:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/csfw.2006.24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"PK8RUEYG","journalArticle","1997","Vincent Aleven; Vincent Aleven","Teaching case-based argumentation through a model and examples","","","","","","CATO is an intelligent learning environment designed to help beginning law students learn basic skills of making arguments with cases. Using CATO, students practice tasks of induction and analogical argumentation. They practice testing theories against a body of cases and making written arguments about a problem, comparing and contrasting it to past cases. CATO's model addresses arguments in which two opponents analogize a problem to favorable cases, distinguish unfavorable cases, assess the significance of similarities and differences between cases in light of normative knowledge about the domain, and use that knowledge to organize multi-case arguments. CATO communicates the model to students by presenting dynamically-generated argumentation examples and by reifying argument structure based on the model. CATO also provides a case database and tools based on the model that help make students' tasks more manageable. CATO was evaluated in the context of an actual legal writing course, in a study involving 30 first-year law students. We found that instruction with CATO leads to statistically significant improvement in students' basic argumentation skills, comparable to that achieved by an experienced legal writing instructor teaching groups of 4-10 students. However, on a more advanced legal writing assignment, meant to explore the frontier of the CATO instruction, students taught by the legal writing instructor had higher grades, suggesting a need for more integrated practice with the CATO model. CATO contributes to AI research fields modeling educational techniques as well as case-based and legal reasoning. It is a novel result that students can learn basic argumentation skills by studying computer-generated examples. It means that an instructional system does not necessarily need to rely on a very sophisticated understanding of students' arguments, which would be a significant obstacle to developing such systems. Also, CATO presents novel techniques for using background knowledge to support similarity assessment in case-based reasoning. Drawing on its background knowledge, CATO characterizes and re-characterizes cases in order to argue that two cases are similar or different. This is an important skill in the legal domain not previously modeled. CATO's arguments may help a user in assessing the similarity of cases in a more discriminatory way.","1997","2025-03-26 12:56:39","2025-03-26 12:56:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Teaching%20case-based%20argumentation%20through%20a%20model%20and%20examples","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ashley","Modeling Legal Argument: Reasoning with Cases and Hypotheticals","","","","","","This dissertation is about adversarial, case-based reasoning and the HYPO program that performs adversarial reasoning with cases and hypotheticals in the legal domain. The dissertation identifies and describes basic case-based operations, an adversarial, case-based reasoning process, a schematic structure for case-based arguments, the kinds of counter-examples that arise and the knowledge sources necessary to support adversarial, case-based reasoning. The HYPO program embodies the methodology. It comprises: (1) a structured Case Knowledge Base (""CKB"") of actual legal cases; (2) an indexing scheme (""dimensions"") for retrieval of relevant cases from the CKB; (3) methods for analyzing problem situations and retrieving relevant cases; (4) methods for interpreting and assessing the relevancy of past cases by ""positioning"" the problem situation with respect to relevant existing cases in the CKB as seen from the viewpoint of the problem at hand and finding the most-on-point cases; (5) methods for comparing/contrasting cases (e.g., citing, distinguishing, finding counter-examples); (6) methods for posing hypotheticals that test the sensitivity of the problem situation to changes, particularly with regard to potentially adverse effects of new damaging facts coming to light and existing favorable ones being discredited; (7) methods for generating ""3-ply"" argument outlines to play out realistic legal arguments citing cases in a manner familiar to attorneys; and (8) methods for explaining alternative decisions of the problem situation by posing hypotheticals, comparing arguments and summarizing the precedents. HYPO's performance compares favorably to that of judges and attorneys in actual legal cases. The law is an excellent domain to study case-based reasoning since by its very nature it: (1) espouses a doctrine of precedent in which prior cases are the primary tools for justifying legal conclusions; and (2) employs precedential reasoning to make up for the lack of strong domain models with which to reason deductively about problem situations. The law is also a paradigm for adversarial case-based reasoning; there are ""no right answers"", only arguments pitting interpretations of cases and facts against each other. The dissertation addresses issues of central concern to Artificial Intelligence including: relevance and credit assignment, indexing and inference control, argumentation, analogical reasoning and explanation.","1991","2025-03-26 12:56:39","2025-03-26 12:56:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Modeling%20Legal%20Argument:%20Reasoning%20with%20Cases%20and%20Hypotheticals","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After giving a legal-theoretical account of judicial reasoning with precedents, a formal method is proposed for representing precedents and it is discussed how such representations can be used in a formally defined dialectical protocol for dispute. The basic ideas are to represent cases as argument structures (including pro and con arguments, and the arguments for adjudicating their conflicts) and to define certain case-based reasoning moves as strategies for introducing information into a dispute. In particular, analogizing and distinguishing are conceived as elementary theory construction moves, which produce new information on the basis of an existing stock of cases. The approach also offers the possibility of using portions of precedents and of expressing criteria for determining the outcome of precedent-based disputes.","1998","2025-03-26 12:56:39","2025-03-26 12:56:39","","","","","","","Artificial Intelligence and Law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-015-9010-5_5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We do so by first developing a theory for argumentation whose central notion is the acceptability of arguments. Then we argue for the “correctness” or “appropriateness” of our theory with two strong arguments. The first one shows that most of the major approaches to nonmonotonic reasoning in AI and logic programming are special forms of our theory of argumentation. The second argument illustrates how our theory can be used to investigate the logical structure of many practical problems. This argument is based on a result showing that our theory captures naturally the solutions of the theory of n-person games and of the well-known stable marriage problem. By showing that argumentation can be viewed as a special form of logic programming with negation as failure, we introduce a general logic-programming-based method for generating meta-interpreters for argumentation systems, a method very much similar to the compiler-compiler idea in conventional programming.

Many contributions involve extracting legal requirements, providing law-compliant business processes, as well as managing and maintaining compliance. In this paper, we report on a systematic literature review focusing on goal-oriented legal compliance of business processes. 88 papers were selected out of nearly 800 unique papers extracted from five search engines, with manual additions from the Requirements Engineering Journal and four relevant conferences. We grouped these papers in eight categories based on a set of criteria and then highlight their main contributions. We found that the main areas for contributions have been in extracting legal requirements, modeling them with goal modeling languages, and integrating them with business processes. We identify gaps and opportunities for future work in areas related to prioritization to improve compliance, templates for generating law-compliant processes, general links between legal requirements, goal models, and business processes, and semi-automation of legal compliance and analysis.","2011","2025-03-26 12:56:39","2025-03-26 12:56:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/relaw.2011.6050270","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bench-Capon","Persuasion in Practical Argument Using Value-based Argumentation Frameworks","Journal of Logic and Computation","","","10.1093/logcom/13.3.429","","In many cases of disagreement, particularly in situations involving practical reasoning, it is impossible to demonstrate conclusively that either party is wrong. The role of argument in such cases is to persuade rather than to prove, demonstrate or refute. Following Perelman, we argue that persuasion in such cases relies on a recognition that the strength of an argument depends on the social values that it advances, and that whether the attack of one argument on another succeeds depends on the comparative strength of the values advanced by the arguments concerned. To model this we extend the standard notion of Argumentation Frameworks (AFs) to Value-based Argumentation Frameworks (VAFs). After defining VAFs we explore their properties, and show how they can provide a rational basis for the acceptance or rejection of arguments, even where this would appear to be a matter of choice in a standard AF .I n particular we show that in a VAF certain arguments can be shown to be acceptable however the relative strengths of the values involved are assessed. This means that disputants can concur on the acceptance of arguments, even when they differ as to which values are more important, and hence that we can identify points for which persuasion should be possible. We illustrate the above using an example moral debate. We then show how factual considerations can be admitted to our framework and discuss the possibility of persuasion in the face of uncertainty and disagreement as to values.","2003","2025-03-26 12:56:39","2025-03-26 12:56:39","","","","","","","Journal of Logic and Computation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1093/logcom/13.3.429","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Each move is associated with a set of theory constructors, and thus each point in the space can be associated with a theory intended to explain the seed case and the other cases in the domain. The space is large and so an heuristic search method is needed. This paper describes two methods based on A* and alpha/beta pruning and also a series of experiments designed to explore the appropriateness of different evaluation functions, the most useful precedents to use as seed cases and the quality of the resulting theories.","2005","2025-03-26 12:56:39","2025-03-26 12:56:39","","","","","","","Artificial Intelligence and Law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10506-006-9004-2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To achieve this, they require access to health data. These data are sensitive since they contain personal information. Governments have legislation to ensure that privacy is respected and hospitals must comply with it. Unfortunately, most of the procedures meant to control access to health information remain paper-based, making it difficult to trace. In this paper, we introduce a framework based on the User Requirements Notation that models the business processes of a hospital and links them with legislation such as the Ontario Personal Health Information Privacy Act (PHIPA).

It also presents an original computational model which aims to integrate the features of these prior systems. The ‘mainstream’ conception of argumentation in the field of artificial intelligence is monological and deductive [6]. Argumentation is viewed as taking place against the background of an inconsistent knowledge base, where the knowledge base is a set of propositions represented in some formal logic. Argumentation in this conception is a method for deducing warranted propositions from an inconsistent knowledge base. Which statements are warranted depends on attack relations among the arguments [10] which can be constructed from the knowledge base. The notions of proof standards and burden of proof become relevant only when argumentation is viewed as a dialogical process for making justified decisions. The input to the process is an initial claim or issue. The goal of the process is to clarify and decide the issues, and produce a justification of the decision which can withstand a critical evaluation by a particular audience. The role of the audience could be played by the respondent or a neutral-third party, depending on the type of dialogue. The output of this process consists of: 1) a set of claims, 2) the decision to accept or reject each claim, 3) a theory of the generalizations of the domain and the facts of the particular case, and 4) a proof justifying the decision of each issues, showing how the decision is supported by the theory. Notice that a theory or knowledge-base is part of the output of argumentation dialogues, not, as in the deductive conception, its input.

Companies are subject to new regulations from one or more governing bodies, when companies introduce new or existing products into a jurisdiction, when regulations change, or when data is transferred across political borders. To address this problem, we developed a framework called “requirements water marking” that business analysts can use to align and reconcile requirements from multiple jurisdictions (municipalities, provinces, nations) to produce a single high or low standard of care. We evaluate the framework in an empirical case study conducted over a subset of U.S. data breach notification laws that require companies to secure their data and notify consumers in the event of data loss or theft. In this study, applying our framework reduced the number of requirements a company must comply with by 76% across 8 jurisdictions. We show how the framework surfaces critical requirements trade-offs and potential regulatory conflicts that companies must address during the reconciliation process. We summarize our results, including surveys of information technology law experts to contextualize our empirical results in legal practice.","2012","2025-03-26 12:56:39","2025-03-26 12:56:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/re.2012.6345843","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We identify three particular aspects of practical reasoning which distinguish it from theoretical reasoning. We next provide an argument scheme and an associated set of critical questions which is able to capture these features. In order that both the argument scheme and the critical questions can be given precise interpretations we use the semantic structure of an Action-Based Alternating Transition System as the basis for their definition. We then work through a detailed example to show how this approach to practical reasoning can be applied to a problem solving situation, and briefly describe some other previous applications of the general approach. In a second example we relate our account to the social laws paradigm for co-ordinating multi-agent systems. The contribution of the paper is to provide firm foundations for an approach to practical reasoning based on presumptive argument in terms of a well-known model for representing the effects of actions of a group of agents.","2007","2025-03-26 12:56:39","2025-03-26 12:56:39","","","","","","","Artificial Intelligence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artint.2007.04.009","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Requirements are not all equally important to the final software system because time constraints, expense, and design can each raise the urgency of implementing some requirements before others. Laws and regulations can make requirements prioritization particularly challenging due to the high costs of noncompliance and the substantial amount of domain knowledge needed to make prioritization decisions. In the context of legal requirements, implementation order ideally should be influenced by the laws and regulations governing a given software system.

Its use is illustrated with applications to realistic legal examples, and the potential for implementation is discussed. The framework has the form of a logical system for defeasible argumentation. Its language, which is of a logic-programming-like nature, has both weak and explicit negation, and conflicts between arguments are decided with the help of priorities on the rules. An important feature of the system is that these priorities are not fixed, but are themselves defeasibly derived as conclusions within the system. Thus debates on the choice between conflicting arguments can also be modelled. The proof theory of the system is stated in dialectical style, where a proof takes the form of a dialogue between a proponent and an opponent of an argument. An argument is shown to be justified if the proponent can make the opponent run out of moves in whatever way the opponent attacks. Despite this dialectical form, the system reflects a `declarative', or `relational' approach to modelling legal argument. A basic assumption of this paper is that this approach complements two other lines of research in AI and Law, investigations of precedent-based reasoning and the development of `procedural', or `dialectical' models of legal argument.","1996","2025-03-26 12:56:39","2025-03-26 12:56:39","","","","","","","Artificial Intelligence and Law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/bf00118496","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To build such tools, it is necessary first to design a uniform representation for the structure of arguments; law has provided us with a good starting point for understanding this structure. Since arguments are important legal artifacts, law maintains a recorded institutional memory of them in forms such as casebooks, databases, and courtroom transcripts. This analysis is primarily concerned with the arguments that occur in two excerpts from Supreme Court oral argument transcripts; it is directed toward developing a system of semi-formal representations of the structure of these arguments in hypertext. A system of representations of argument structure, coupled with an understanding of the argumentation process, can be used to form the basis for tools for authoring, fault-detection, and other activities associated with formulating and presenting rationale.","1989","2025-03-26 12:56:39","2025-03-26 12:56:39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1145/74014.74031","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As BankXX searches its heterogeneous and highly interconnected network of domain knowledge, information is incrementally analyzed and amalgamated into a dozen desirable ingredients for argument (called argument pieces), such as citations to cases, applications of legal theories, and references to prototypical factual scenarios. At the conclusion of the search, BankXX outputs the set of argument pieces filled with harvested material relevant to the input problem situation. This research explores the appropriateness of the search paradigm as a framework for harvesting and mining information needed to make legal arguments. In this article, we describe how legal research fits the heuristic search framework and detail how this model is used in BankXX. We describe the BankXX program with emphasis on its representation of legal knowledge and legal argument. We describe the heuristic search mechanism and evaluation functions that drive the program. We give an extended example of the processing of BankXX on the facts of an actual legal case in BankXX's application domain -- the good faith question of Chapter 13 personal bankruptcy law.

Accordingly, arguments can in ASPIC+ be attacked in three ways: on their uncertain premises, or on their defeasible inferences, or on the conclusions of their defeasible inferences.

The model applies proof standards to determine the acceptability of statements on an issue-by-issue basis. The model uses different types of premises (ordinary premises, assumptions and exceptions) and information about the dialectical status of statements (stated, questioned, accepted or rejected) to allow the burden of proof to be allocated to the proponent or the respondent, as appropriate, for each premise separately. Our approach allows the burden of proof for a premise to be assigned to a different party than the one who has the burden of proving the conclusion of the argument, and also to change the burden of proof or applicable proof standard as the dialogue progresses from stage to stage. Useful for modeling legal dialogues, the burden of production and burden of persuasion can be handled separately, with a different responsible party and applicable proof standard for each. Carneades enables critical questions of argumentation schemes to be modeled as additional premises, using premise types to capture the varying effect on the burden of proof of different kinds of questions.","2007","2025-03-26 12:56:39","2025-03-26 12:56:39","","","","","","","Artificial Intelligence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artint.2007.04.010","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To demonstrate that a product complies with these goals, businesses need to identify and refine legal requirements into product requirements and integrate the product requirements into their ongoing product design and testing processes. We report on an industry case study in which product requirements were specified to comply with Section 508 of the U.S. Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998. This study sought to identify: limitations in existing requirements-acquisition methods; compliance gaps between previously specified product requirements and Section 508; and additional sources of knowledge that are necessary to refine legal requirements into product requirements to comply with the law. Our study reveals the need for a community of practice and generalizable techniques that can reduce ambiguity, complexity and redundancy in legal and product requirements and manage innovation in product requirements. We present these findings with several examples from Section 508 regulations and actual product requirements that are implemented in Cisco products.","2008","2025-03-26 12:56:40","2025-03-26 12:56:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/re.2008.36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, we provide a reconstruction of the reasoning of the majority and dissenting opinions for a particular well-known case from property law. This is done through the use of Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents to replicate the contrasting views involved in the actual decision. This reconstruction suggests that the reasoning involved can be separated into three distinct levels: factual and normative levels and a level connecting the two, with conclusions at one level forming premises at the next. We begin by summarising our general approach, which uses instantiations of an argumentation scheme to provide presumptive justifications for actions, and critical questions to identify arguments which attack these justifications. These arguments and attacks are organised into argumentation frameworks to identify the status of individual arguments. We then discuss the levels of reasoning that occur in this reconstruction and the properties and significance of each of these levels. We illustrate the different levels with short examples and also include a discussion of the role of precedents within these levels of reasoning.","2005","2025-03-26 12:56:40","2025-03-26 12:56:40","","","","","","","Artificial Intelligence and Law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10506-006-9003-3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The analysis of results focuses on frequencies of publications for categories within the scheme. Thereby, the coverage of the research field can be determined. Different facets of the scheme can also be combined to answer more specific research questions. OBJECTIVE: We describe how to conduct a systematic mapping study in software engineering and provide guidelines. We also compare systematic maps and systematic reviews to clarify how to chose between them. This comparison leads to a set of guidelines for systematic maps. METHOD: We have defined a systematic mapping process and applied it to complete a systematic mapping study. Furthermore, we compare systematic maps with systematic reviews by systematically analyzing existing systematic reviews. RESULTS: We describe a process for software engineering systematic mapping studies and compare it to systematic reviews. Based on this, guidelines for conducting systematic maps are defined. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic maps and reviews are different in terms of goals, breadth, validity issues and implications. Thus, they should be used complementarily and require different methods (e.g., for analysis).","2008","2025-03-26 12:56:40","2025-03-26 12:56:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.14236/ewic/ease2008.8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper we show how Carneades argument evaluation structures can be reconstructed as abstract dialectical frameworks (ADFs), a recently proposed generalization of Dung argumentation frameworks (AFs). This not only provides at least an indirect link between Carneades and AFs, it also allows us to handle arbitrary argument cycles, thus lifting a restriction of Carneades.

We analyze three aspects of legalcontext: the teleological relations that connect legal precedents to the socialvalues and policies they serve, the temporal relations between prior andsubsequent cases in a legal domain, and the procedural posture of legal cases,which defines the scope of their precedential relevance. Using real examples drawnfrom appellate courts of New York and Massachusetts, we show with the courts' ownarguments that the doctrine of stare decisis (i.e., similar facts should lead to similar results) is subject to contextual constraints and influences. For each of the three aspects of legal context, we outline an expanded computational framework for case-based legal reasoning that encompasses the reasoning of the examples, and provides a foundation for generating a more robust set of legal arguments.","2002","2025-03-26 12:56:40","2025-03-26 12:56:40","","","","","","","Artificial Intelligence and Law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1023/a:1019516031847","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given a model of law and a model of stakeholders goals, legal alternatives are identified and explored. Strategic goals that can realise legal prescriptions are systematically analysed, and alternative ways of fulfilling a law are evaluated. The approach is demonstrated by means of a case study.

Such networks are generated based on citation relations between cases found in legal corpora as well as legal issues being discussed with these citations. Unlike traditional tools, the System allows legal professionals to efficiently study legal issues without having to go through whole cases or tedious manual citation search. This shift of focus from cases to individual issues within cases would greatly reduce time required for attorneys and legal scholars who have specific research problems in mind.

Such a separation gives the discussion a clear structure and prevents time and resources from being wasted on evaluating arguments for proposals based on unacceptable criteria. Argument schemes for both phases are defined and formalised in a logical framework for structured argumentation. The process of deliberation is abstracted from and it is assumed that both deliberation phases result in a set of arguments and attack and defeat relations between them. The acceptability status of criteria and proposals within the resulting argumentation framework is then evaluated using preferred semantics.

Laws and regulations contain internal cross-references to portions of the same legal text, as well as cross-references to external legal texts. These cross-references introduce ambiguities, exceptions, as well as other challenges to regulatory compliance. Requirements engineers need guidance as to how to address cross-references in order to comply with the requirements of the law. Herein, we analyze each external cross-reference within the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule, the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA), and the GLBA Financial Privacy Rule to determine whether a cross-reference either introduces a conflicting requirement, a conflicting definition, or refines an existing requirement. Herein, we propose a legal cross-reference taxonomy to aid requirements engineers in classifying cross-references as they specify compliance requirements. Analyzing cross-references enables us to address conflicting requirements that may otherwise thwart legal compliance. We identify five sets of conflicting compliance requirements and recommend strategies for resolving these conflicts.","2012","2025-03-26 12:56:40","2025-03-26 12:56:40","","","","","","","Requirements Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-012-0152-5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Requirements engineers that develop software for regulated domains, such as healthcare or finance, must adapt their software as laws change to maintain legal compliance. In the United States, regulatory agencies will almost always release a proposed regulation, or rule, and accept comments from the public. The agency then considers these comments when drafting a final rule that will be binding on the regulated domain. Herein, we examine how these proposed rules evolve into final rules, and propose an Adaptability Framework. This framework can aid software engineers in predicting what areas of a proposed rule are most likely to evolve, allowing engineers to begin building towards the more stable sections of the rule. We develop the framework through a formative study using the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability (HIPAA) Security Rule and apply it in a summative study on the Health Information Technology: Initial Set of Standards, Implementation Specifications, and Certification Criteria for Electronic Health Record Technology.","2012","2025-03-26 12:56:40","2025-03-26 12:56:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/re.2012.6345793","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Requirements modeling can be used to extract important legal constraints from laws, and decide how, and evaluate if an information system design complies to applicable laws. To advance research on evaluating requirements modeling formalisms for the representation of legal information, we propose several benchmarks that we believe represent important challenges in modeling laws and requirements governing information systems, and evaluating the compliance of these requirements with laws. While incomplete, the proposed set of benchmarks covers a range of challenges in modeling laws and requirements that we observed in privacy and security law: from the possibility to trace model fragments to law fragments, to the ability to distinguish modalities in law, and to model relations between requirements and law fragments, needed when evaluating compliance. Benchmarks can be used as a checklist when designing and discussing requirements formalisms that support legal requirements modeling. Each benchmark is motivated by related work, a brief legal excerpt, and our experience in modeling regulations.","2013","2025-03-26 12:56:40","2025-03-26 12:56:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/relaw.2013.6671343","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The formal model of disputation is derived from recent work in argument. The five kinds of rationales are compilation rationales, which can be represented without assuming domain-knowledge (such as utilities) beyond that normally required for argument. The principal thesis is that such rationales can be analyzed in a framework of argument not too different from what AI already has. The result is a formal understanding of rationales, a partial taxonomy, and a foundation for computer programs that represent and reason with rationales. The five kinds of rationales are as follows: (c)ompression and (s)pecialization, which yield rules, and (d)isputation, which yields a decision. These are modeled as potentially changing the focus of the dispute. Then there are (f)it, a rationale for rules, and (r)esolution, a rationale for decisions. These cannot be modeled as simply; they force disputation to a meta-level, at least temporarily. The paper first discusses each kind of rationale in the abstract. Then it produces a model of dispute in which the simpler rationales can be analyzed. Formal examples are given. The model is augmented to allow analysis of the more difficult rationales. Examples are again given. The discussion is not intended to be strictly mathematical; rather, it aims to use formal methods to illuminate and provide framework for future interpretation and implementation.","1995","2025-03-26 12:56:40","2025-03-26 12:56:40","","","","","","","Artificial Intelligence and Law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/bf00872529","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Arguments are defined as inference trees formed by applying two kinds of inference rules: strict and defeasible rules. This naturally leads to three ways of attacking an argument: attacking a premise, attacking a conclusion and attacking an inference. To resolve such attacks, preferences may be used, which leads to three corresponding kinds of defeat: undermining, rebutting and undercutting defeats. The nature of the inference rules, the structure of the logical language on which they operate and the origin of the preferences are, apart from some basic assumptions, left unspecified.

Prior research has shown that graduate-level software engineering students are not able to reliably determine whether software requirements meet or exceed their legal obligations and that professional software engineers are unable to accurately classify cross-references in legal texts. However, no research has determined whether software engineers are able to identify and classify important ambiguities in laws and regulations. Ambiguities in legal texts can make the difference between requirements compliance and non-compliance. Herein, we develop a ambiguity taxonomy based on software engineering, legal, and linguistic understandings of ambiguity. We examine how 17 technologists and policy analysts in a graduate-level course use this taxonomy to identify ambiguity in a legal text. We also examine the types of ambiguities they found and whether they believe those ambiguities should prevent software engineers from implementing software that complies with the legal text. Our research suggests that ambiguity is prevalent in legal texts. In 50 minutes of examination, participants in our case study identified on average 33.47 ambiguities in 104 lines of legal text using our ambiguity taxonomy as a guideline. Our analysis suggests (a) that participants used the taxonomy as intended: as a guide and (b) that the taxonomy provides adequate coverage (97.5%) of the ambiguities found in the legal text.","2014","2025-03-26 12:56:40","2025-03-26 12:56:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/re.2014.6912250","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lodder","Hard cases: a procedural approach","Artificial Intelligence and Law","","","10.1007/bf00871759","","Much work on legal knowledge systems treats legal reasoning as arguments that lead from a description of the law and the facts of a case, to the legal conclusion for the case. The reasoning steps of the inference engine parallel the logical steps by means of which the legal conclusion is derived from the factual and legal premises. In short, the relation between the input and the output of a legal inference engine is a logical one. The truth of the conclusion only depends on the premises, and is independent of the argument that leads to the conclusion. This paper opposes the logical approach, and defends a procedural approach to legal reasoning. Legal conclusions are not true or false independent of the reasoning process that ended in these conclusions. In critical cases this reasoning process consists of an adversarial procedure in which several parties are involved. The course of the argument determines whether the conclusion is true or false. The phenomenon of hard cases is used to demonstrate this essential procedural nature of legal reasoning. Dialogical Reason Based Logic offers a framework that makes it possible to model legal dialogues. We use Dialogical Reason Based Logic to specify hard cases in dialogical terms. Moreover, we analyse an actual Dutch hard case in terms of Dialogical Reason Based Logic, to demonstrate both the possibilities and the shortcomings of this approach. It turns out that there is no one set of rational dialogue rules. There are many concurring sets of rules that govern particular types of dialogues. The rules for legal procedures are as much part of the law as the more substantial rules. As a consequence, it is not possible to offer an universal set of dialogue rules. Dialogical Reason Based Logic rather provides a framework which can be filled with dialogue rules that determine which dialogues are valid and which ones are invalid.","1993","2025-03-26 12:56:40","2025-03-26 12:56:40","","","","","","","Artificial Intelligence and Law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/bf00871759","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This work examines the challenge of developing tool support for extracting such requirements from legal documents. To address this challenge, we have developed a tool called GaiusT. The tool is founded on a framework for textual semantic annotation. It semiautomatically generates elements of requirements models, including actors, rights, and obligations. We present the complexities of annotating prescriptive text, the architecture of GaiusT, and the process by which annotation is accomplished. We also present experimental results from two case studies to illustrate the application of the tool and its effectiveness relative to manual efforts.

By identifying the structure of an argument in terms of its constituents and the relationships between them, it becomes easier to critically evaluate each part of an argument in turn. The task of analysis and diagramming, however, is labor intensive and often idiosyncratic, which can make academic exchange difficult. The Araucaria system provides an interface which supports the diagramming process, and then saves the result using AML, an open standard, designed in XML, for describing argument structure. Araucaria aims to be of use not only in pedagogical situations, but also in support of research activity. As a result, it has been designed from the outset to handle more advanced argumentation theoretic concepts such as schemes, which capture stereotypical patterns of reasoning. The software is also designed to be compatible with a number of applications under development, including dialogic interaction and online corpus provision. Together, these features, combined with its platform independence and ease of use, have the potential to make Araucaria a valuable resource for the academic community.","2004","2025-03-26 12:56:40","2025-03-26 12:56:40","","","","","","","International Journal on Artificial Intelligence Tools","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1142/s0218213004001922","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its distinctive feature is that each statement can be given its own proof standard, which is claimed to allow a more natural account of reasoning under burden of proof than existing formalisms for structured argumentation, in which proof standards are defined globally. In this article, the two formalisms are formally related by translating Carneades into the ASPIC+ framework for structured argumentation. Since ASPIC+ is defined to generate Dung-style abstract argumentation frameworks, this in effect translates Carneades graphs into abstract argumentation frameworks. For this translation, we prove a formal correspondence and show that certain rationality postulates hold. It is furthermore proved that Carneades always induces a unique Dung extension, which is the same in all of Dung's semantics, allowing us to generalise Carneades to cycle-containi...","2012","2025-03-26 12:56:41","2025-03-26 12:56:41","","","","","","","Argument & Computation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1080/19462166.2012.661766","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Freeman; Kathleen Freeman; Kathleen Freeman","Burden of proof in legal argumentation","","","","10.1145/222092.222227","","We present a computational model of dialectical argumentation that could serve as a basis for studying elements of legal reasoning. Argumentation is well-suited to decisionmaking in the legal domain, where knowledge is incomplete, uncertain, and inconsistent, We model an argument both as information structure, i.e., argument units connecting claims with supporting data, and as dialectical process, i.e., an alternating series of moves made by opposing sides. Inspired by the legal domain, our model includes burden of proof as a key element, indicating the level of support that must be achieved by a particular side to an argument. Burden of proof acts as a move filter and termination criterion during argumentation and determines the eventual winner. We demonstrate our model by considering two examples that have been discussed previously in the artificial intelligence and legal reasoning literature. INTRODUCTION As the artificial intelligence (AI) and legal reasoning communities are well aware, most decisions are reached against a background of incomplete, uncertain, and inconsistent knowledge (i.e., weak theory domains; Porter, et. al., 1990). The most widely used AI methods for reasoning under uncertainty either rely on an absence of outright contradictions (e. g., probabilistic reasoning; Pearl, 1987) or are unable to support motivated decision-making in the face of inconsistent information (e.g., default reasoning; Ginsberg, 1987). Both solutions put the problem of deciding what to believe outside their respective domains of discourse.

Ashley","Ontological requirements for analogical, teleological, and hypothetical legal reasoning","","","","10.1145/1568234.1568236","","In 1993, Berman and Hafner criticized case-based models of legal reasoning for not modeling analogical and teleological elements. Another lesson learned since then is the role of ontologies in representing domain knowledge so that a legal reasoning system can represent and solve problems. If the reasoning involves drawing abstract analogies, reasoning teleologically about rules for deciding a case, and posing hypothetical cases to test decision rules, however, it is not clear what requirements the ontology should satisfy. This paper presents an extended example of such legal reasoning to illustrate what an ontology for case-based legal reasoning should provide. The example centers on a microworld of legal discourse, an ensemble of real legal cases, hypothetical examples, concepts, factors, principles and policies. Beginning with any case in the microworld, the system's goal is to generate arguments that a law professor and students might reasonably make in discussing the legal case in class. The example illustrates three roles the ontology should play in providing representational support for the system, distills the ontological requirements, and suggests an incremental approach to making good on Berman's and Hafner's challenge.","2009","2025-03-26 12:56:41","2025-03-26 12:56:41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1145/1568234.1568236","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Different regulations can partially overlap (e.g., one can be more detailed than the other) or even conflict with each other. In addition, one regulation can permit an action whereas the same action in another regulation might be mandatory or forbidden. In each of these cases, an organization needs to take different strategies. This paper presents an approach to handle different situations when comparing and attempting to comply with multiple regulations as part of a goal-oriented modeling framework named LEGAL-URN. This framework helps organizations find suitable trade-offs and priorities when complying with multiple regulations while at the same time trying to meet their own business objectives. The approach is illustrated with a case study involving a Canadian health care organization that must comply with four laws related to privacy, quality of care, freedom of information, and care consent.","2014","2025-03-26 12:56:41","2025-03-26 12:56:41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/re.2014.6912249","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ontologies, however, are static, and so have only a limited role in reasoning about domains in which change matters. In this paper, we focus on the domain of policy deliberation, where policy decisions are designed to change things to realise particular social values. We explore how a particular kind of state transition system can be constructed to serve as a semantic model to support reasoning about alternative policy decisions. The policy making process includes stages that support the construction of a model, which can then be exploited in reasoning. The reasoning itself will be driven by a particular argumentation scheme for practical reasoning, and the ways in which arguments based on this scheme can be attacked and evaluated. The evaluation provides alternative policy positions.

We evaluate the framework in two empirical case studies covering a subset of U.S. data breach notification laws and medical record retention laws.

Our goal is to develop tools and techniques that help requirements engineers and policy makers bring policies and system requirements into better alignment. Goals from requirements engineering are useful for distilling natural language policy statements into structured descriptions of these interactions; however, they are limited in that they are not easy to compare with one another despite sharing common semantic features. In this paper, we describe a process called semantic parameterization that we use to derive semantic models from goals mined from privacy policy documents. We present example semantic models that enable comparing policy statements and present a template method for generating natural language policy statements (and ultimately requirements) from unique semantic models. The semantic models are described by a context-free grammar called KTL that has been validated within the context of the most frequently expressed goals in over 100 Internet privacy policy documents. KTL is supported by a policy analysis tool that supports queries and policy statement generation.","2005","2025-03-26 12:56:41","2025-03-26 12:56:41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/re.2005.12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To this end, software engineers must determine which requirements have met or exceeded their legal obligations and which requirements have not. Requirements that have met or exceeded their legal obligations are legally implementation ready, whereas requirements that have not met or exceeded their legal obligations need further refinement. Research is needed to better understand how to support software engineers in making these determinations. In this paper, we describe a case study in which we asked graduate-level software engineering students to assess whether a set of software requirements for an electronic health record system met or exceeded their corresponding legal obligations as expressed in regulations created pursuant to the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). We compare the assessment made by graduate students with an assessment made by HIPAA compliance subject matter experts. Additionally, we contrast these results with those generated by a legal requirements triage algorithm. Our findings suggest that the average graduate-level software engineering student is ill-prepared to write legally compliant software with any confidence and that domain experts are an absolute necessity. Our findings also indicate the potential utility of legal requirements metrics in aiding software engineers as they make legal compliance decisions.","2011","2025-03-26 12:56:41","2025-03-26 12:56:41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/re.2011.6051661","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, software design, expense, and time constraints all inuence how requirements are prioritized. Prioritizing requirements derived from laws and regulations can be untenable using traditional pairwise requirements prioritization techniques because the number of pairwise comparisons grows quadratically with the number of requirements. In this paper, we introduce legal requirements triage{{a technique used to subdivide a requirements set into three subsets: (a) implementation ready legal requirements; (b) legal requirements that require further renement; and (c) non-legal requirements. Legal requirements triage supplements a traditional pairwise requirements prioritization by focusing analysts on implementation ready legal requirements to reduce the number of pairwise comparisons. Herein, we discuss a case study in which we applied these techniques to prioritize 75 functional requirements for the iTrust Medical Records System, an open-source electronic health records system that must comply with the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Our study shows that we were able to reduce signicantly the number of pairwise comparisons.","2010","2025-03-26 12:56:41","2025-03-26 12:56:41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Triage%20for%20legal%20requirements","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus far we have taken the factors associated with cases to be given in the knowledge base. While this is adequate for expressing factor based reasoning, we can further investigate the justifications for the relationship between factors and facts or evidence.

In this paper, we report on a computational requirements document expressible using a legal requirements specification language (LRSL). The purpose is to make legal requirements open and available to policy makers, business analysts and software developers, alike. We show how requirements engineers can codify policy and law using the LRSL and design, debug, analyze, trace, and visualize relationships among regulatory requirements. The LRSL provides new constructs for expressing distributed constraints, making regulatory specification patterns visually salient, and enabling metrics to quantitatively measure different styles for writing legal and policy documents.

An important aspect of these authoritative rules is directly related to the way by which software systems, used by the regulated companies, are built, tested, and maintained. As a result, many regulated companies have turned to their software vendors to request their support in the compliance efforts. For most global software vendors, this new situation represents a significant challenge. From the technological standpoint, the complexity and sheer volume of typical authoritative rules poses a serious obstacle to implementing effective compliance support strategies. From the organizational perspective, the delivery of compliance support activities requires efficient business processes, skilled and valued employees, and a strong governance model with commitment at all management levels. To address these issues, we present a compliance support framework that aims to facilitate the linkage between compliance requirements, software development practices, and business process management. We believe that, if implemented properly, this framework can significantly improve the way software companies handle the increasing customer demand for compliance support. It can turn compliance support into a revenue-generating activity, and possibly a competitive advantage.","2007","2025-03-26 12:56:42","2025-03-26 12:56:42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Towards%20a%20compliance%20support%20framework%20for%20global%20software%20companies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This development is welcome, since few topics are more relevant to legal craft and education than the interpretation of statutes, now our primary source of law. The recent theoretical views, however, contrast with practicing lawyers' strategies of statutory interpretation. When practitioners give advice to clients about what a statute means, their approach is usually eclectic: They look at the text of the relevant statutory provisions, any legislative history that is available, the context in which the legislation was enacted, the overall legal landscape, and the lessons of common sense and good policy. But when law professors talk about statutory interpretation, they tend to posit a more abstract, ""grand"" theory that privileges one or another of these approaches as ""foundational.""2 The commentators' grand theories contrast with the more ad hoc, factbased reasoning of the practicing lawyer. How do judges interpret statutes? How should they? Many commentators argue that judicial interpretation is, or at least ought to be, inspired by grand theory.

"XX6J7UD8","journalArticle","1993","Kathleen Freeman; Kathleen Freeman","Toward formalizing dialectical argumentation","","","","","","The construction of arguments has long been viewed as a paradigmatic example of human reasoning and, as such, is an important ability for computer programs that attempt to model intelligent behavior. We explore the use of argumentation for deriving and justifying claims in domains where knowledge is incomplete, uncertain, or inconsistent, i.e., weak theory domains. Argumentation supports a notion of proof appropriate for reasoning in weak theory domains, e.g., a claim is proved if there is plausible, irrefutable support for the claim, and there is no such support for any counter-claim. We present elements of a theory of argumentation involving two senses of argument, argument as supporting explanation and argument as dialectical process. For argument as supporting explanation, we create argument structures that organize relevant, available support for both a claim and its negation. In dialectical argument, the format of a two-sided argument process is used to intertwine the strengths and weaknesses of support for competing claims, so arguments can be refuted and directly compared. Our account of dialectical argumentation includes a catalog of argument moves and a set of heuristics for selecting moves and thereby controlling argument generation. This model, which has been implemented in a computer program, is a flexible environment for exploring the representation and generation of arguments. We show how the program generates reasonable arguments for a set of example problems. We give an analysis of the program, including limits of the current model of argumentation. For artificial intelligence programs, the ability to generate arguments provides a useful technique for reasoning in real world contexts. For argumentation researchers, artificial intelligence methodology offers a new way for evaluating theories of argumentation.","1993","2025-03-26 12:56:42","2025-03-26 12:56:42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Toward%20formalizing%20dialectical%20argumentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the role of control objectives stemming from regulationsand standards is becoming increasingly important for businesses in light ofrecent events that led to some of the largest scandals in corporate history. Asorganizations strive to meet compliance agendas, there is an evident need toprovide systematic approaches that assist in the understanding of the interplaybetween (often conflicting) business and control objectives during businessprocess design. In this paper, our objective is twofold. We will firstly present aresearch agenda in the space of business process compliance, identifying majortechnical and organizational challenges. We then tackle a part of the overallproblem space, which deals with the effective modeling of control objectivesand subsequently their propagation onto business process models. Controlobjective modeling is proposed through a specialized modal logic based onnormative systems theory, and the visualization of control objectives onbusiness process models is achieved procedurally. The proposed approach isdemonstrated in the context of a purchase-to-pay scenario.","2007","2025-03-26 12:56:42","2025-03-26 12:56:42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-75183-0_12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pollock","Cognitive Carpentry: A Blueprint for How to Build a Person","","","","","","From the Publisher: In his groundbreaking new book, John Pollock establishes an outpost at the crossroads where artificial intelligence meets philosophy. Specifically, he proposes a general theory of rationality and then describes its implementation in OSCAR, an architecture for an autonomous rational agent he claims is the ""first AI system capable of performing reasoning that philosophers would regard as epistemically sophisticated."" A sequel to Pollock's How to Build a Person, this volume builds upon that theoretical groundwork for the implementation of rationality through artificial intelligence. Pollock argues that progress in AI has stalled because of its creators' reliance upon unformulated intuitions about rationality. Instead, he bases the OSCAR architecture upon an explicit philosophical theory of rationality, encompassing principles of practical cognition, epistemic cognition, and defeasible reasoning. One of the results is the world's first automated defeasible reasoner capable of reasoning in a rich, logical environment. Underlying Pollock's thesis is a conviction that the tenets of artifical intelligence and those of philosophy can be complementary and mutually beneficial. And, while members of both camps have in recent years grown skeptical of the very possibility of ""symbol processing"" AI, Cognitive Carpentry establishes that such an approach to AI can be successful.

A Dung argumentation framework is instantiated by arguments and a binary conflict based attack relation, defined by some underlying logical theory. The justified arguments under different extensional semantics are then evaluated, and the claims of these arguments define the inferences of the underlying theory. To determine a unique set of justified arguments often requires a preference relation on arguments to determine the success of attacks between arguments. However, preference information is often itself defeasible, conflicting and so subject to argumentation. Hence, in this paper we extend Dung's theory to accommodate arguments that claim preferences between other arguments, thus incorporating meta-level argumentation based reasoning about preferences in the object level. We then define and study application of the full range of Dung's extensional semantics to the extended framework, and study special classes of the extended framework. The extended theory preserves the abstract nature of Dung's approach, thus aiming at a general framework for non-monotonic formalisms that accommodate defeasible reasoning about as well as with preference information. We illustrate by formalising argument based logic programming with defeasible priorities in the extended theory.","2009","2025-03-26 12:56:42","2025-03-26 12:56:42","","","","","","","Artificial Intelligence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.artint.2009.02.001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sherman","A Prolog model of the income tax act of Canada","","","","10.1145/41735.41750","","The use of computers in Canadian tax planning has until now been concentrated on numerical analysis. The computer is indeed an excellent tool for calculating tax effects where the legal results of transactions are known. However, I maintain that it can be equally useful as a tool for analysing transactions to determine what those legal results are. The complexities of the Canadian tax system are such that a given transaction could have unintended tax results, where the facts resulting from the transaction fit the words of a rule which may have been designed for, and is perceived as applying to, different circumstances altogether.  In this paper I consider the structure and form of the Income Tax Act and show how it is well-designed for computerization. I then review the primary design considerations for a computer-based tax planning system. Finally, I describe the implementation of a partial tax analysis system which I have programmed in Prolog, and review its deficiencies and the extensions which would be required to make it a useful planning tool for tax practitioners.

More and more regulations in the service sector are, or are aimed to be, outcome-focused regulations. An outcome prescribed in the regulation is what users should experience or achieve when the regulated business processes are compliant. Service providers need to proactively ensure that the outcomes specified in the regulations have been achieved prior to conducting the relevant part of the business or prior to inspectors discovering noncompliance. Published approaches check requirements or business processes, not outcomes, against regulations and thus this still leaves uncertain as to whether what the users actually experience is what is prescribed in the regulations. In this research preview paper., we propose a method for assessing the compliance of process outcomes. Actual outcomes from business processes are checked against prescribed outcomes from the regulations. The method is illustrated by an example from the U.K.'s CQC regulations in the care-home environment. The key contribution of this paper is a preliminary approach for proactively checking the compliance of process outcomes.","2013","2025-03-26 12:56:42","2025-03-26 12:56:42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/relaw.2013.6671342","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The logic extends the system of Prakken (2001), which in turn modified the system of Prakken & Sartor (1996) with the possibility to distribute the burden of proof over both sides in an argument game. First the (2001) system is put in the context of a distinction of three types of proof burdens and it is argued that the proof burdens of that system are in fact burdens of persuasion. Then the (2001) system is modified to allow for defeasible reasoning about allocations of such burdens within the logic.

Thus, organizations must include their privacy policies as a source of requirements in order to build systems that are policy-compliant. In this paper, we describe an empirical user study in which we measure the ability of requirements engineers to effectively extract compliance requirements from a privacy policy using one of three analysis approaches—CPR (commitment, privilege, and right) analysis, goal-based analysis, and non-methodassisted (control) analysis. The results of these three approaches were then compared to an expert-produced set of expected compliance requirements. The requirements extracted by the CPR subjects reflected a higher percentage of requirements that were expected compliance requirements as well as a higher percentage of the total expected compliance requirements. In contrast, the goal-based and control subjects produced a higher number of synthesized requirements, or requirements not directly derived from the policy than the CPR subjects. This larger number of synthesized requirements may be attributed to the fact that these two subject groups employed more inquiry-driven approaches than the CPR subjects who relied primarily on focused and direct extraction of compliance requirements.","2012","2025-03-26 12:56:43","2025-03-26 12:56:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/relaw.2012.6347806","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Timur Friedman","BankXX: a program to generate argument through case-base search","","","","10.1145/158976.158991","","In this paper we describe a system, called BankXX, which generates arguments by performing a heuristic best-first search of a highly interconnected network of legal knowledge. The legal knowledge includes cases represented from a variety of points of view—cases as collections of facts, cases as dimensionally-analyzed fact situations, cases as bundles of citations, and cases as prototypical factual scripts—as well as legal theories represented in terms of domain factors. BankXX performs its search for useful information using one of three evaluation functions encoded at different levels of abstraction: the domain level, an “argument-piece” level, and the overall argument level. Evaluation at the domain level uses easily accessible information about the nodes,  such  as their type; evaluation at the argument-piece level uses information about generally useful components of case-based argument, such as best cases and supporting legal theories; evaluation at the overall-argument level uses factors, called argument dimensions, which address the overall substance and quality of an argument, such as the centrality of its supporting cases or the success record of its best theory. BankXX is instantiated in the area of personal bankruptcy governed by Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which permits a debtor to be discharged from debts through completion of a court-approved payment plan. In particular, our system addresses the requirement that such Chapter 13 plans be “proposed in good faith.”","1993","2025-03-26 12:56:43","2025-03-26 12:56:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1145/158976.158991","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Once you agree on these requirements, you can use them as a focal point for the development process and produce a software system that meets the expectations of both customers and users. However, in real world software development, there are usually more requirements than you can implement given stakeholders' time and resource constraints. Thus, project managers face a dilemma: how do you select a subset of the customers' requirements and still produce a system that meets their needs?

CAT0 models ways in which experts compare and contrast cases, assess the significance of similarities and differences between cases in light of general domain knowledge, and use the same general knowledge to organize multi-case arguments by issues. CAT0 communicates its model to students by presenting dynamically-generated argumentation examples and reifying (i.e., making visible) argument structure. Also, the CAT0 Tools reduce some of the distracting complexity of the students’ task. gal education seeks to teach. But they are difficult to learn and time-consuming to teach. If computer-based instruction can help students get some extra practice in basic skills and free up instructor’s time for more advanced topics, much would be gained. We evaluated CAT0 in the context of a second-semester Iegal writing course taught at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. We found that 7.5 hours of CAT0 instruction led to a statistically significant improvement in students’ basic argumentation skills, comparable to that achieved, in the same amount of time, by an experienced legal writing instructor teaching small groups of students in a more traditional way. On a more advanced memo-writing assignment, meant to explore the “frontier” of the CAT0 instruction, students taught by the legal writing instructor did better, indicating that more is needed if CAT0 is to help students to improve their memo-writing skills. CAT0 employs a computational model of case-based argumentation that addresses eight basic argument moves and more elaborate multi-case arguments. The model includes a “Factor Hierarchy,” which represents more nbstract., but still domain-specific, legal knowledge about the meaning of the factors used to represent cases. CAT0 uses the Factor Hierarchy for a number of purposes, among them to organize multi-case arguments by issues and to make arguments about the significance of distinctions. To generate the latter, CAT0 strategically selects alternative interpretations of cases to elaborate a “deeper” (or more. abstract) contrast or parallel between cases.","1997","2025-03-26 12:56:43","2025-03-26 12:56:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1145/261618.261650","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"I4UKQ9RP","journalArticle","1961","Herbert Lionel Adolphus Hart; H. L. A. Hart","The Concept of Law","","","","","","The Concept of Law is the most important and original work of legal philosophy written this century. First published in 1961, it is considered the masterpiece of H.L.A. Hart's enormous contribution to the study of jurisprudence and legal philosophy. Its elegant language and balanced arguments have sparked wide debate and unprecedented growth in the quantity and quality of scholarship in this area--much of it devoted to attacking or defending Hart's theories. Principal among Hart's critics is renowned lawyer and political philosopher Ronald Dworkin who in the 1970s and 80s mounted a series of challenges to Hart's Concept of Law. It seemed that Hart let these challenges go unanswered until, after his death in 1992, his answer to Dworkin's criticism was discovered among his papers. In this valuable and long-awaited new edition Hart presents an Epilogue in which he answers Dworkin and some of his other most influential critics including Fuller and Finnis. Written with the same clarity and candor for which the first edition is famous, the Epilogue offers a sharper interpretation of Hart's own views, rebuffs the arguments of critics like Dworkin, and powerfully asserts that they have based their criticisms on a faulty understanding of Hart's work. Hart demonstrates that Dworkin's views are in fact strikingly similar to his own. In a final analysis, Hart's response leaves Dworkin's criticisms considerably weakened and his positions largely in question. Containing Hart's final and powerful response to Dworkin in addition to the revised text of the original Concept of Law, this thought-provoking and persuasively argued volume is essential reading for lawyers and philosophers throughout the world.","1961","2025-03-26 12:56:43","2025-03-26 12:56:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=The%20Concept%20of%20Law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Entities are instances of a set of types. Procedures for determining the values of attributes are Horn clause rules indexed by type. The known types of an entity determine its set of applicable rules, which changes as our knowledge about the types of the entity is refined, supporting a form of defeasible reasoning.

Bench-Capon","Factors, issues and values: revisiting reasoning with cases","","","","10.1145/2746090.2746103","","In this paper we revisit reasoning with legal cases, with a view to articulating the relationships between issues, factors, facts and values, and to identifying areas for future work on these topics. We start from the different ways in which attempts have been made to go beyond a fortori reasoning from the precedent base, so that conclusions not fully justified by the precedents can be drawn. We then use a particular example domain taken from the literature to illustrate our preferred approach and to relate factors and values. From this we observe that much current work depends critically on the ascription of factors to cases in a Boolean manner, while in practice there are compelling reasons to see the presence of factors as a matter of degree. On the basis of our observations we make suggestions for the directions of future work on this topic.","2015","2025-03-26 12:56:43","2025-03-26 12:56:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1145/2746090.2746103","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Gray Cygnets (GCs) are cases that are highly similar and subsequent to novel, surprising, provocative, exceptional cases, so-called Black Swans. They too are surprising, exceptional and provocative in the sense of continuing the change initiated by the Black Swan. Our experiments were carried out using a corpus of common law cases from the United States, particularly New York and Massachusetts, and the United Kingdom primarily in the era 1852-1916 during which there was dramatic change in the prevailing doctrine regarding recovery for damages by a remote buyer. It was provoked by the 1852 landmark case Thomas & Wife v. Winchester and elaborated in subsequent cases. Our methods use similarity measures from Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) based on classic claim lattice and nearest neighbor techniques. We also define and use ""supreme on-point cases"" (sopc's) that reside in the root node of a claim lattice. We define four simple tests to determine whether a problem case is a potential Gray Cygnet. The tests use the position of a known Black Swan in the analysis of a problem case, specifically whether it appears as a sopc, or mopc, and/or as a nearest neighbor. We also use the tests as an ensemble by using the decision of their majority vote. To evaluate the performance of our tests, we created an answer key based on a closed form definition of a GC in our domain.","2011","2025-03-26 12:56:43","2025-03-26 12:56:43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1145/2018358.2018381","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Arguments are expressed in a logic-programming language with both weak and strong negation, conflicts between arguments are decided with the help of priorities on the rules. An important feature of the system is that these priorities are not fixed, but are themselves defeasibly derived as conclusions within the system. Thus debates on the choice between conflicting arguments can also be modelled. The semantics of the system is given with a fixpoint definition, while its proof theory is stated in dialectical style, where a proof takes the form of a dialogue between a proponent and an opponent of an argument: an argument is shown to be justified if the proponent can make the opponent run out of moves in whatever way the opponent attacks.","1997","2025-03-26 12:56:43","2025-03-26 12:56:43","","","","","","","Journal of Applied Non-Classical Logics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1080/11663081.1997.10510900","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, policy documents contain legalese and present readability challenges to requirements engineers seeking to analyze them. In this paper, we perform a large-scale analysis of 2,061 policy documents, including policy documents from the Google Top 1000 most visited websites and the Fortune 500 companies, for three purposes: (1) to assess the readability of these policy documents for requirements engineers; (2) to determine if automated text mining can indicate whether a policy document contains requirements expressed as either privacy protections or vulnerabilities; and (3) to establish the generalizability of prior work in the identification of privacy protections and vulnerabilities from privacy policies to other policy documents.

The paper consists of three parts. The first part describes a model of legal reasoning based on a two-layered view of the law. The first layer consists of principles and goals that express fundamental ideas of a legal system. The second layer contains legal rules which in a sense summarise the outcome of the interaction of the principles and goals for a number of case types. Both principles, goals and rules can be used in legal arguments, but their logical roles are different. One characteristic of the model of legal reasoning described in the first part of the paper is that it takes these logical differences into account. Another characteristic is that it pays serious attention to the phenomena of reasoning about the validity and acceptance of rules, respectively principles and goals, and about the application of legal rules, and the implications of these arguments for the use of rules, principles and goals in deriving legal conclusions for concrete cases. The second part of the paper first describes a logic (Reason-Based Logic) that is especially suited to deal with legal arguments as described in terms of the previously discussed model. The facilities of the logic are illustrated by means of examples that correspond to the several aspects of the model. The third part of the paper deals with a number of logico-philosophical reflections on Reason-Based Logic. The occasion is also used to compare these presuppositions with theories of defeasible reasoning based on the comparison of arguments.","1996","2025-03-26 12:56:44","2025-03-26 12:56:44","","","","","","","Artificial Intelligence and Law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/bf00118493","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We focus on business rather than technical services. We think of a business contract as specifying the functional and nonfunctional behaviors of and interactions among the services. In current practice, contracts are produced as text documents. Thus the relevant service capabilities, requirements, qualities, and risks are hidden and difficult to access and reason about. We describe a simple but effective unsupervised information extraction approach and tool, Contract Miner, for discovering service exceptions at the phrase level from a large contract repository. Our approach involves preprocessing followed by an application of linguistic patterns and parsing to extract the service exception phrases. Identifying such (noun) phrases can help build service exception vocabularies that support the development of a taxonomy of business terms, and also facilitate modeling and analyzing service engagements. A lightweight online tool that comes with Contract Miner highlights the relevant text in service contracts and thereby assists users in reviewing contracts.

However, C&A security requirements are expressed in multiple regulatory documents with complex interdependencies at different levels of abstractions that often result in subjective interpretations and non-standard implementations. Their non-functional nature imposes complex constraints on the emergent behavior of software-intensive systems, making them hard to understand, predict, and control. To address these issues, we present novel techniques from software requirements engineering and knowledge engineering for systematically extracting, modeling, and analyzing security requirements and related concepts from multiple C&A-enforced regulatory documents.

Then a model of teleological reasoning is brought to bear on choices affecting different goals, among which those prescribed by constitutional norms. An analytical framework is provided for evaluating such choices with regard to possible alternatives. The assessment of legislative choices according to proportionality is then considered, and is modelled using the provided analytical framework.

In this paper, we will argue that the simplification involved in using factors, while it has proved pragmatically useful both for clarifying understanding of certain aspects of reasoning with cases and for implementation, causes problems with domain analysis and precludes certain kinds of argument that we would wish to model. We therefore believe that the time is now ripe to go back to the original notion of dimensions, while retaining the insights that have been gained from working with the simpler notion of factors.

Such analysis can allow modelers to assess the satisfaction of goals, facilitate evaluation of high-level design alternatives, help analysts decide on the high-level requirements and design of the system, test the sanity of a model, and support communication and learning. The analysis of goal models can be done in very different ways depending on the nature of the model and the purpose of the analysis. In our work, we use the Goal-oriented Requirement Language (GRL), which is part of the User Requirements Notation (URN). URN, a new Recommendation of the International Telecommunications Union, provides the first standard goal-oriented language. Using GRL, we develop an approach to analysis that can be done by evaluating qualitative or quantitative satisfaction levels of the actors and intentional elements (e.g., goals and tasks) composing the model. Initial satisfaction levels for some of the intentional elements are provided in a strategy and then propagated to the other intentional elements of the model through the various links that connect them. The results allow for an assessment of the relative effectiveness of design alternatives at the requirements level. Although no specific propagation algorithm is imposed in the URN standard, different criteria for defining evaluation mechanisms are described. We provide three algorithms (quantitative, qualitative, and hybrid) as examples, which satisfy the constraints imposed by the standard. These algorithms have been implemented in the open-source jUCMNav tool, an Eclipse-based editor for URN models. The algorithms are presented and compared with the help of a telecommunication system example. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","2010","2025-03-26 12:56:44","2025-03-26 12:56:44","","","","","","","International Journal of Intelligent Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1002/int.v25:8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Argumentation schemes - a notion borrowed from the field of argumentation theory - are a kind of generalized rules of inference, in the sense that they express that given certain premises a particular conclusion can be drawn. However, argumentation schemes need not concern strict, abstract, necessarily valid patterns of reasoning, but can be defeasible, concrete and contingently valid, i.e., valid in certain contexts or under certain circumstances. A method is presented to analyze argumentation schemes and it is shown how argumentation schemes can be embedded in a formal model of dialectical argumentation.

Providing tools and techniques to evaluate the compliance degree of a given process is a key objective in emerging business process platforms. We propose a diagnostic framework to assess the compliance gaps present in a given process. Checking whether a process is compliant with the rules involves enumerating all reachable states and is hence, in general, a hard search problem. The approach taken here allows to provide useful diagnostic information in polynomial time based on two underlying techniques. A conceptually faithful representation for regulatory obligations is firstly provided by a formal rule language based on a non-monotonic deontic logic of violations. Secondly, processes are formalized through semantic annotations that allow a logical state space to be created. The intersection of the two allows us to devise an efficient method to detect compliance gaps.","2008","2025-03-26 12:56:44","2025-03-26 12:56:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-00328-8_2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is industrial practice to define such requirements in form of natural language (NL) documents. Currently existing approaches to analyzing NL confidentiality requirements rely on a manual linguistic transformation and normalization of the original text, prior to the analysis. This paper presents an alternative approach to analyzing requirements by using semantic annotations placed directly into the original NL documents. The benefits of this alternative approach are twofold: (1) it can effectively be supported by an interactive annotation tool and (2) there is a direct traceability between annotation structures and the original NL documents. We have evaluated our method and tool support using the same real-world case study that was used to evaluate the earlier linguistic approach.

Legal interpretations essentially affect decisions made in refining goals, or making goals more concrete, that are directly or indirectly established by the law. As common and conventional interpretations are gradually identified and become widespread through appearances of cases and guidelines, goal refinement relationships need to be constantly managed and adjusted to the latest legal interpretations. This paper discusses an initial approach to management of legal interpretations together with goal-oriented requirements engineering, through a motivating example of a Japanese law on trade secrets. Specifically, this study proposes a metamodel for legal interpretation. In the metamodel, legal interpretations are modeled as refinement relationships between definitions of concepts or terms and then analyzed by matching with instances. Legal interpretations can then be woven into goal trees as criteria of goal refinement.","2009","2025-03-26 12:56:44","2025-03-26 12:56:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/relaw.2009.8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Users need to understand these policies in order to know how their personal information is being collected, stored, used, and protected. Organizations need to ensure that the commitments they express in their privacy policies reflect their actual business practices, especially in the United States where the Federal Trade Commission regulates fair business practices. Requirements engineers need to understand the privacy policies to know the privacy practices with which the software must comply and to ensure that the commitments expressed in these privacy policies are incorporated into the software requirements. In this paper, we present a methodology for obtaining requirements from privacy policies based on our theory of commitments, privileges, and rights, which was developed through a grounded theory approach. This methodology was developed from a case study in which we derived software requirements from seventeen healthcare privacy policies. We found that legal-based approaches do not provide sufficient coverage of privacy requirements because privacy policies focus primarily on procedural practices rather than legal practices.","2011","2025-03-26 12:56:44","2025-03-26 12:56:44","","","","","","","Requirements Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-010-0108-6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the current version of AHOHFELD the original conceptions have been modified and extended in seeking to define a language sufficiently robust to express all LEGAL RELATIONS and all changes in legal states of affairs. Hohfeld emphasized the use of fundamental legal conceptions in the analysis of judicial reasoning, elsewhere we have shown the use of A-HOHFELD for the analysis of sets of statutory rules, and here we illustrate its use in thinking about legal doctrine. This use of A-HOHFELD is offered as a possible example of where fluency in a more precise and complete language might have facilitated an earlier recognition of remedial alternatives that have apparently only recently been appearing in legal literature and judicial decisions.

In these approaches, first-principle prioritization criteria are replaced by a pairwise preference elicitation process. Nevertheless case-based approaches, using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique, become impractical when the size of the collection of requirements is greater than about twenty since the elicitation effort grows as the square of the number of requirements. We adopt a case-based framework for requirements prioritization, called case-based ranking, which exploits machine learning techniques to overcome the scalability problem. This method reduces the acquisition effort by combining human preference elicitation and automatic preference approximation. Our goal in this paper is to describe the framework in details and to present empirical evaluations which aim at showing its effectiveness in overcoming the scalability problem. The results prove that on average our approach outperforms AHP with respect to the trade-off between expert elicitation effort and the requirement prioritization accuracy.","2005","2025-03-26 12:56:44","2025-03-26 12:56:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/re.2005.30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Any variables are assumed to be universally quantified, with a scope which is the entire sentence. A negated condition “not A i ” is deemed to hold if the corresponding positive condition A i  can be shown to fail to hold. This interpretation of negative conditions is called negation by failure (NBF) [Cl 78]. It has the characteristic that only the positive “if-half” of a definition needs to be given explicity. The negative “only-if” half is given implicitly by NBF.  The obvious problem with NBF is that it supplies the only-if halves of implications, whether or not they are intended. I shall discuss a possible solution to this problem in the context of discussing the more general problem of representing negative conclusions. I shall focus on examples taken from our formalisation of the 1981 British Nationality Act (BNA) [SSKKHC 86]. I shall argue that many negative sentences can be regarded as integrity constraints and consequently can be eliminated by transformations such as those developed by Asirelli et al [ASM 85] and Kowalski and Sadri [KS 88]. Among such sentences are ones expressing prohibitions. The interpretation of prohibitions as integrity constraints suggests a possible approach to the treatment of deontic modalities.","1989","2025-03-26 12:56:44","2025-03-26 12:56:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1145/74014.74016","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Lack of an effective prioritization and triage process can lead to problems such as missed deadlines, disorganized development efforts, and late discovery of architecturally significant requirements. Existing prioritization techniques do not provide sufficient automation for large projects with hundreds of stakeholders and thousands of potentially conflicting requests and requirements. This paper therefore proposes an approach for automating a significant part of the prioritization process. The proposed method utilizes a probabilistic traceability model combined with a standard hierarchical clustering algorithm to cluster incoming stakeholder requests into hierarchical feature sets. Additional cross-cutting clusters are then generated to represent factors such as architecturally significant requirements or impacted business goals. Prioritization decisions are initially made at the feature level and then more critical requirements are promoted according to their relationships with the identified cross-cutting concerns. The approach is illustrated and evaluated through a case study applied to the requirements of the ice breaker system.","2007","2025-03-26 12:56:44","2025-03-26 12:56:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/re.2007.63","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing AI & law models of legal dialogues and argumentation-theoretic models of persuasion are extended with a neutral third party, to give a more realistic account of the adjudicator's role in legal procedures. The main feature of the model is a division into an argumentation phase, where the adversaries plea their case and the adjudicator has a largely mediating role, and a decision phase, where the adjudicator decides the dispute on the basis of the claims, arguments and evidence put forward in the argumentation phase. The model allows for explicit decisions on admissibility of evidence and burden of proof by the adjudicator in the argumentation phase. Adjudication is modelled as putting forward arguments, in particular undercutting and priority arguments, in the decision phase. The model reconciles logical aspects of burden of proof induced by the defeasible nature of arguments with dialogical aspects of burden of proof as something that can be allocated by explicit decisions on legal grounds.","2008","2025-03-26 12:56:44","2025-03-26 12:56:44","","","","","","","Artificial Intelligence and Law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10506-008-9066-4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compliance should be enforced during all phases of business process lifecycle, from the phases of analysis and design to deployment, monitoring and evaluation. In this paper, a taxonomy of compliance constraints for business processes is introduced based on the notion of compliance patterns. Patterns facilitate the formal specification of compliance constraints that enable their verification and analysis against business process models. This taxonomy serves as the backbone of the root-cause analysis, which is conducted to reason about and eventually to resolve design-time compliance violations, by providing appropriate guidelines as remedies to alleviate design-time compliance deviations.

It has been shown by Panter and Dite that, in the limit as the number of quanta becomes infinite, the asymptotic fractional density of quanta per unit voltage should vary as the one-third power of the probability density per unit voltage of signal amplitudes. In this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization criterion used is that the average quantization noise power be a minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large.

Consumers often have only the stated Web site policies as a guide to how their information is used, and thus on which to base their browsing and transaction decisions. However, each policy is different, and it is difficult—if not impossible—for the average user to compare and comprehend these policies. This paper presents a taxonomy of privacy requirements for Web sites. Using goal-mining, the extraction of pre-requirements goals from post-requirements text artefacts, we analysed an initial set of Internet privacy policies to develop the taxonomy. This taxonomy was then validated during a second goal extraction exercise, involving privacy policies from a range of health care related Web sites. This validation effort enabled further refinement to the taxonomy, culminating in two classes of privacy requirements: protection goals and vulnerabilities. Protection goals express the desired protection of consumer privacy rights, whereas vulnerabilities describe requirements that potentially threaten consumer privacy. The identified taxonomy categories are useful for analysing implicit internal conflicts within privacy policies, the corresponding Web sites, and their manner of operation. These categories can be used by Web site designers to reduce Web site privacy vulnerabilities and ensure that their stated and actual policies are consistent with each other. The same categories can be used by customers to evaluate and understand policies and their limitations. Additionally, the policies have potential use by third-party evaluators of site policies and conflicts.","2004","2025-03-26 12:56:44","2025-03-26 12:56:44","","","","","","","Requirements Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-003-0183-z","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When an assumption is prima facie justified, there can for instance be a reason against it, by which the assumption is not actually justified. The assumption is then said to be defeated. This requires a revision of the standard conception of logical interpretation of sets of assumptions in terms of their models. Whereas in the models of a set of assumptions, all assumptions are taken to be true, an interpretation of prima facie justified assumptions must distinguish between the assumptions that are actually justified in the interpretation and those that are defeated. In the present paper, the logical interpretation of prima facie justified assumptions is investigated. The central notion is that of a dialectical interpretation of a set of assumptions. The basic idea is that a prima facie justified assumption is not actually justified, but defeated when its so-called dialectical negation is justified. The properties of dialectical interpretation are analysed by considering partial dialectical interpretations, or stages, and by establishing the notion of dialectical justification. The latter leads to a characterization of the existence and multiplicity of the dialectical interpretations of a set of assumptions. Since dialectical interpretations are a variant of stable semantics, the results are relevant for existing work on nonmonotonic logic and defeasible reasoning, on which the present work builds. Instead of focusing on defeasible rules or arguments, the present approach is sentence-based. A particular innovation is the use of a conditional that is prima facie justified (just like other assumptions) instead of an inconclusive conditional.","2003","2025-03-26 12:56:44","2025-03-26 12:56:44","","","","","","","Journal of Logic and Computation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1093/logcom/13.3.319","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The framework includes a method to translate IT regulations into a legal requirements coverage model used to make coverage assertions about existing or planned IT systems. We evaluated the framework in a case study using three IT laws: California's Confidentiality of Medical Records Act, the U.S. Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and amendments from the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, and the India 2011 Information Technology Rules.

The sheer volume of regulatory compliance requirements for even a small company can be considerably high, which renders the understanding of such authoritative rules a challenging task without tool support. After inspecting several regulatory documents, we noticed that they contain a significant number of citations that, if explored effectively, can reveal important information about the containing documents. In this paper, we propose a technique called citation analysis that aims at helping users to understand and analyze regulatory documents in an efficient manner. Our approach is based on the exploration of citation graphs extracted from regulatory documents. We discuss the challenges when dealing with citations. We also present an overview of a tool that can support citation analysis.","2009","2025-03-26 12:56:45","2025-03-26 12:56:45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/itng.2009.161","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Horty","RULES AND REASONS IN THE THEORY OF PRECEDENT","Legal Theory","","","10.1017/s1352325211000036","","The doctrine of precedent, as it has evolved within the common law, has at its heart a form of reasoning—broadly speaking, a logic—according to which the decisions of earlier courts in particular cases somehow generalize to constrain the decisions of later courts facing different cases, while still allowing these later courts a degree of freedom in responding to fresh circumstances. Although the techniques for arguing on the basis of precedent are taught early on in law schools, mastered with relative ease, and applied on a daily basis by legal practitioners, it has proved to be considerably more difficult to arrive at a theoretical understanding of the doctrine itself—a clear articulation of the underlying logic. My purpose in this paper is to describe a new framework within which we can begin to address this problem. I concentrate on two of the most fundamental questions in the theory of precedent. First, how is it, exactly, that precedent cases constrain future decisions—what is the mechanism of constraint? And second, how is a balance then achieved between the constraints of precedent and the freedoms allowed to later courts for developing the law? The view I present will be contrasted with three other views, or models, of precedential constraint appearing in the literature. The first is the rule model. A precedent case normally contains, not only a description of the facts of the case along with a decision on the basis of those facts, but also some particular rule through which that decision was reached. According to the rule model, it is this rule that carries the precedential constraint. Constraint by precedent just is constraint by rules; a precedent case constrains the decision of a later court when the rule contained in that precedent applies to the fact situation confronting the later court.","2011","2025-03-26 12:56:45","2025-03-26 12:56:45","","","","","","","Legal Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1017/s1352325211000036","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We use Abstract Dialectical Frameworks (ADFs), a recent development in AI knowledge representation, as the central feature of our design method. ADFs will play a role akin to that played by Entity---Relationship models in the design of database systems. First, we explain how the factor hierarchy of the well-known legal reasoning system CATO can be used to instantiate an ADF for the domain of US Trade Secrets. This is intended to demonstrate the suitability of ADFs for expressing the design of legal cased based systems. The method is then applied to two other legal domains often used in the literature of AI and Law. In each domain, the design is provided by the domain analyst expressing the cases in terms of factors organised into an ADF from which an executable program can be implemented in a straightforward way by taking advantage of the closeness of the acceptance conditions of the ADF to components of an executable program. We evaluate the ease of implementation, the performance and efficacy of the resulting program, ease of refinement of the program and the transparency of the reasoning. This evaluation suggests ways in which factor based systems, which are limited by taking as their starting point the representation of cases as sets of factors and so abstracting away the particular facts, can be extended to address open issues in AI and Law by incorporating the case facts to improve the decision, and by considering justification and reasoning using portion of precedents.","2016","2025-03-26 12:56:45","2025-03-26 12:56:45","","","","","","","Artificial Intelligence and Law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10506-016-9178-1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The most prevalent application of legal requirements models is for checking the compliance of software systems with laws and regulations. In this experience paper, we explore a complementary application of legal requirements models, namely simulation. We observe that, in domains such as taxation, the same models that underlie legal compliance analysis bring important added value by enabling simulation. Concretely, this paper reports on the model-based simulation of selected legal requirements (policies) derived from Luxembourg's Income Tax Law. The simulation scenario considered in the paper is aimed at analyzing the impact of a current tax law reform proposal in Luxembourg.

However this cannot come at the price of control objectives which stem from various legislative, standard and business partnership sources. Ensuring the compliance to regulations and industrial standards is an increasingly important issue in the design of business processes. In this paper, we advocate that control objectives should be addressed at an early stage, i.e., design time, so as to minimize the problems of runtime compliance checking and consequent violations and penalties. To this aim, we propose supporting mechanisms for business process designers. This paper specifically presents a support method which allows the process designer to quantitatively measure the compliance degree of a given process model against a set of control objectives. This will allow process designers to comparatively assess the compliance degree of their design as well as be better informed on the cost of non-compliance.","2008","2025-03-26 12:56:45","2025-03-26 12:56:45","","","","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-78238-4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Regulations represent the minimum level of security and dependability with which systems must comply. We develop a methodology for creating production rule models to aid developers in specifying legally compliant software requirements. By querying production rule models, software engineers can gain valuable knowledge of the legal text. They can perform an initial compliance analysis and obtain preliminary compliance requirements that can be further refined in consultation with a lawyer. We model the law using the legal concepts of rights, obligations, privileges, no-rights, powers, liabilities, immunities, and disabilities. Herein, we develop heuristics for specifying production rules that model legal texts.

For most questions, we evaluate trends over time. Our findings show a proliferation of papers with new ideas and few citations, with a small number of authors and papers dominating citations; however, there is a slight rise in papers which build upon past work (implementations, integrations, and extensions). We see a rise in papers concerning adaptation/variability/evolution and a slight rise in case studies. Overall, interest in GORE has increased.

Such analysis can allow modelers to assess the satisfaction of goals, facilitate evaluation of high-level design alternatives, help analysts decide on the high-level requirements and design of the system, test the sanity of a model, and support communication and learning. The analysis of goal models can be done in very different ways depending on the nature of the model and the purpose of the analysis. In our work, we use the Goal-oriented Requirement Language (GRL), which is part of the User Requirements Notation (URN). URN, a new Recommendation of the International Telecommunications Union, provides the first standard goal-oriented language. Using GRL, we develop an approach to analysis that can be done by evaluating qualitative or quantitative satisfaction levels of the actors and intentional elements (e.g., goals and tasks) composing the model. Initial satisfaction levels for some of the intentional elements are provided in a strategy and then propagated to the other intentional elements of the model through the various links that connect them. The results allow for an assessment of the relative effectiveness of design alternatives at the requirements level. Although no specific propagation algorithm is imposed in the URN standard, different criteria for defining evaluation mechanisms are described.

The goal of requirements engineering is to produce a set of system requirements which, as far as possible, is complete, consistent, relevant and reflects what the customer actually wants. Although this ideal is probably unattainable, the use of a systematic approach based on engineering principles leads to better requirements than the informal approach which is still commonly used. This book presents a set of guidelines which reflect the best practice in requirements engineering. Based on the authors' experience in research and in software and systems development, these guidelines explain in an easy-to-understand way how you can improve your requirements engineering processes. The guidelines are applicable for any type of application and, in general, apply to both systems and software engineering.","1997","2025-03-26 12:56:45","2025-03-26 12:56:45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Requirements%20Engineering:%20A%20Good%20Practice%20Guide","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is fortunately no longer possible to speak uncritically of, or simply to assume, the communicational and linguistic dimensions of legal regulation or of legal institutional discourse. While the concepts of communicationof discourse, language, text and sign-have long been key terms of debate within philosophy, literary theory and cultural studies, it is really only very recently that lawyers and particularly the legal academy have begun to take a serious if somewhat defensive interest in these disputes. The issues raised and the interests threatened are ponderous and vast; many of the dogmatic articles of legal faith are at stake and it should not be viewed as surprising if the debates as to the substantive implications of different forms of interpretation appear at times extreme and the positions adopted seem labored or untenable. The issues raised are intrinsically political: a direct challenge is presented to the traditionally established motive and characteristics of legal method, the humanistic tenets of legal philology are denied, and the liberal ideology of the rule of law itself is again placed in question. In such a context the current jurisprudential debates have an uncharacteristic urgency, for it is not simply the legal educational apparatus that is asked to change its course but, more dramatically, it is substantive legal practice and the corresponding professional status or standing of the law that are placed in balance. Clearly the issues adverted to are too broad to form anything more than a general though dynamic context to the present inquiry into the historical status of the legal text as object of interpretation.

The usual choice for expressing elicited requirements is natural language, since it is frequently the only common language to all participants. Problems of natural language are well–known, but using more formal notations too early is a risky choice that can make requirements impossible to understand for customers and users. Moreover, requirements engineers do not usually have good writing skills, and sometimes semantically correct requirements, expressed in natural language, are not understood because of the way they are written. In this paper, we present requirements templates that can improve requirements elicitation and expression, and two kinds of patterns: linguistic patterns, which are very used sentences in natural language requirements descriptions that can be parameterized and integrated into templates, and requirements patterns, which are generic requirements templates that are found very often during the requirements elicitation process and that can be reused with some adaptation.","1999","2025-03-26 12:56:46","2025-03-26 12:56:46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=A%20Requirements%20Elicitation%20Approach%20Based%20in%20Templates%20and%20Patterns.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"9QHZYAXB","journalArticle","2010","Alberto Siena; Alberto Siena","Engineering Law-Compliant Requirements: the Nomos Framework","","","","","","In modern societies, both business and private life are deeply pervaded by software and information systems. Using software has extended human capabilities, allowing information to cross physical and ethical barriers. To handle misuse dangers, governments are increasingly laying down new laws and introducing obligations, rights and responsibilities concerned with the use of software. As a consequence, laws are assuming a steering role in the specification of software requirements, which must be compliant to avoid fines and penalties. This work proposes a model-based approach to the problem of law compliance of software requirements. It aims at extending state-of-the-art goal-oriented requirements engineering techniques with the capability to argue about compliance, through the use and analysis of models. It is based on a language for modelling legal prescriptions. Upon the language, compliance can be defined as a condition that depends on a set of properties. Such a condition is achieved through an iterative modelling process. Specifically, we investigated the nature of legal prescription to capture their conceptual language. From jurisprudence literature, we adopted a taxonomy of legal concepts, which has been elaborated and translated into a conceptual meta-model. Moreover, this metamodel was integrated with the meta-model of a goal-oriented modelling language for requirements engineering, in order to provide a common legal-intentional meta-model. Requirements models built with the proposed language consist of graphs, which ultimately can be verified automatically. Compliance amounts then in a set of properties the graph must have. The compliance condition gains relevance in two cases. Firstly, when a requirements model has already been developed, and it needs to be reconciled with a set of laws. Secondly, when requirements have to be modelled from scratch, and they are need to be compliant. In both cases, compliance results from a design process. The proposed modelling language, as well as the compliance condition and the corresponding design process, have been applied to two case studies. The obtained results confirm the validity of the approach, and point out interesting research directions for the future.","2010","2025-03-26 12:56:46","2025-03-26 12:56:46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Engineering%20Law-Compliant%20Requirements:%20the%20Nomos%20Framework","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

According to the RPT, legal norms can be divided into legal rules and legal principles. One of the main criteria for this distinction is-Alexy argues-that legal rules are applied by means of the Subsumption Formula, while legal principles-by means of the so-called Weight Formula (hereafter: WF). The WF offers an important insight into the structure of the process of balancing in legal reasoning. Alexy's proposal leads to many doubts and questions, however. The aim of the paper is to examine the appropriateness of the WF and the problem of balancing in legal reasoning from the perspective inspired by the constraint satisfaction theory of coherence, developed by Paul Thagard. My claim is that this theory enables us to elucidate many problematic features of the WF and to recast the structure of legal balancing in more transparent and efficient manner. The existing workable algorithms designed for computing other kinds of coherence-based reasoning (for instance, explanatory reasoning or analogical reasoning), make possible to adopt the programs employing these algorithms for computation of coherence in balancing of principles. However, the analysis presented here is mainly conceptual and it has only preparatory character in relation with the possible computational implementations in the future.","2010","2025-03-26 12:56:46","2025-03-26 12:56:46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Balancing%20of%20Legal%20Principles%20and%20Constraint%20Satisfaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article concludes that a rule of stare decisis should govern agencies’ interpretations of ambiguous statutes just as it governs judicial holdings.

In recent years, the practical importance of the study of informai fallacies has been recognized in many an introductory logic text, but very little systematic or sustained attention has been given to exploiting the potentialities of this important area. Fallacies hâve been of relatively constant interest since Aristotle, but on the whole the tendency has been to approach them intuitively and taxonomically rather than to pursue their theoretical aspects at appropriate levels of generality and systematicity. One need not hâve done very much teaching of introductory logic to appreciate that the lack of clear and adequate characterizations of the fallacies makes it virtually impossible to commend to students fallacy-theoretic notions as a really effective strategy in the analysis of argumentation.

It is possible to conceive of certain classes of dialogues as highly rule-governed activities, and to do so facilitates the planning of such dialogues, by decreasing the reliance on a model of the user. One such class of dialogue is interactive argument, in which a topic is discussed with the aim of reaching a conclusion as to the truth of some proposition. We contend that interactive argument provides a useful model of interaction with a KBS, could provide a novel means of knowledge elicitation, and would serve as a fruitful model for educational systems also. Details of a dialogue manager based on a well known dialogue game (Mackenzie’s DC) are given. Since KBS will exist independently of this way of interacting with them we give details of a Dialogue Abstract Machine (DAM), which could serve as a target interface between our dialogue manager and a KBS of any formalism.","2014","2025-03-26 12:56:46","2025-03-26 12:56:46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=INTERACTING%20WITH%20KNOWLEDGE%20BASED%20SYSTEMS%20THROUGH%20DIALOGUE%20GAMES","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They disagree about what standard of conduct should define the obligations of a driver who comes to an unguarded railroad crossing. Holmes offers a rule: The driver must stop and look. Cardozo rejects the rule and instead offers a standard: The driver must act with reasonable caution. Which is the preferable approach? Holmes suggests that the requirements of due care at railroad crossings are clear and, therefore, it is appropriate to crystallize these obligations into a simple rule of law. Cardozo counters with scenarios in which it would be neither wise nor prudent for a driver to stop and look. Holmes might well have answered that Cardozo’s scenarios are exceptions and that exceptions prove the rule. Indeed, Holmes might have parried by suggesting that the definition of a standard of conduct by means of a legal rule is predictable and certain, whereas standards and juries are not.

Even though there are previous relevant results they have primarily focused on quantitative research methods and in particular experiments.

In educational settings the purpose of dialogue is often to elicit the position of a student, e.g. to test understanding. In other settings, a frequently adopted tactic is to attack an opponent's stance by exposing internal inconsistencies in their argument. In real debate such inconsistencies will often be rather more subtle than elementary logical fallacies since they arise from contradictions apparent in the opponent's value system. Protagonists will be better positioned to judge the applicability of this tactic as more information is determined concerning the exact nature of their opponent's case, e.g. the arguments favoured and values endorsed.

Requirements engineering is a task difficult enough when done locally -but it is even more difficult when cross-functional stakeholder groups specify requirements across cultural, language and time zone boundaries. This paper reports on a field study that investigated RE challenges introduced by stakeholders’ geographical distribution in a multi-site organization. The goal was to examine RE practice in global software development, to formulate recommendations for improvement as well as to provide directions for future research on methods and tools. Based on the empirical evidence, we have constructed a model of how remote communication and knowledge management, cultural diversity and time differences negatively impact on requirements gathering, negotiation and specification. Findings reveal that aspects such as a lack of a common understanding of requirements, together with reduced awareness of working local context, trust level and ability to share work artifacts significantly challenge the effective collaboration of remote stakeholders in negotiating a set of requirements that satisfies geographically distributed customers. The paper concludes with recommendations for improving RE practice in this setting.","2004","2025-03-26 12:56:47","2025-03-26 12:56:47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Requirements%20Engineering%20challenges%20in%20multi-site%20software%20development%20organizations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the utility of goal models is greatly enhanced when they can be exploited during downstream stages of the requirements analysis process (e.g. requirements elaboration, validation, planning), and can be used as part of the entire system life cycle (e.g., architectural and behavioral process design, coding, testing, monitoring, adaptation, and evolution). In order to better understand the progress that has been made in integrating goal models with downstream system development, the authors ask: what approaches exist that map/integrate/transform goal models to later stage software artifacts? To answer this question, they conduct a systematic survey, producing a roadmap of work summarizing 243 publications. Results include a categorization of the â€œwhy?â€ and â€œhow?â€ for each approach. Furthermore, they select the 50 most prominent publications, based on citation numbers, in order to perform an in-depth literature review. Findings show that there is a wide variety of proposals with a variety of proposed goal models and targets, covering multiple paradigms, motivated by a variety of purposes. The authors conclude that although much work has been done in this area, the work is fragmented, following multiple separate strands of goal-orientation, and is often still in early stages of maturity.","2015","2025-03-26 12:56:47","2025-03-26 12:56:47","","","","","","","International Journal of Information System Modeling and Design","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.4018/ijismd.2015040101","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Their power largely derives from the abstract nature of the arguments within the framework, where arguments are atomic nodes in an undifferentiated relation of attack. This abstraction conceals different conceptions of argument, and concrete instantiations encounter difficulties as a result of conflating these conceptions. We distinguish three distinct senses of the term. We provide an approach to instantiating AF in which the nodes are restricted to literals and rules, encoding the underlying theory directly. Arguments, in each of the three senses, then emerge from this framework as distinctive structures of nodes and paths. Our framework retains the theoretical and computational benefits of an abstract af, while keeping notions distinct which are conflated in other approaches to instantiation.","2013","2025-03-26 12:56:47","2025-03-26 12:56:47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-40624-9_3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To deal with the problem, we build a model of the law and contrast it with a model of the requirements of the system. In earlier work, we proposed a modelling language for law (Nomos 2) along with a reasoning mechanism that answers questions about compliance. In this paper we extend Nomos 2 to include the concepts of role and requirement so that we can reason about compliance in specific domains. Also, Nomos 3 represents the distribution of responsibilities to roles, distinguishing social from legal roles. Nomos 3 models allow us to reason about compliance of requirements and roles with the norms that constitute a law. A small case study is used to illustrate the elements of Nomos 3 and the kinds of reasoning it supports.","2014","2025-03-26 12:56:47","2025-03-26 12:56:47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-12206-9_22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"QVIPQ2E8","journalArticle","2001","Larry Alexander; Emily Sherwin; Emily Sherwin","The Rule of Rules: Morality, Rules, and the Dilemmas of Law","","","","","","Rules perform a moral function by restating moral principles in concrete terms, so as to reduce the uncertainty, error, and controversy that result when individuals follow their own unconstrained moral judgment. Although reason dictates that we must follow rules to avoid destructive error and controversy, rules—and hence laws—are imperfect, and reason also dictates that we ought not follow them when we believe they produce the wrong result in a particular case. In The Rule of Rules Larry Alexander and Emily Sherwin examine this dilemma. Once the importance of this moral and practical conflict is acknowledged, the authors argue, authoritative rules become the central problems of jurisprudence. The inevitable gap between rules and background morality cannot be bridged, they claim, although many contemporary jurisprudential schools of thought are misguided attempts to do so. Alexander and Sherwin work through this dilemma, which lies at the heart of such ongoing jurisprudential controversies as how judges should reason in deciding cases, what effect should be given to legal precedent, and what status, if any, should be accorded to “legal principles.” In the end, their rigorous discussion sheds light on such topics as the nature of interpretation, the ancient dispute among legal theorists over natural law versus positivism, the obligation to obey law, constitutionalism, and the relation between law and coercion. Those interested in jurisprudence, legal theory, and political philosophy will benefit from the edifying discussion in The Rule of Rules.","2001","2025-03-26 12:56:47","2025-03-26 12:56:47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=The%20Rule%20of%20Rules:%20Morality,%20Rules,%20and%20the%20Dilemmas%20of%20Law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, current goal modeling approaches do not scale well when handling large regulations with many variable parts that depend on different aspects of regulated organizations. In this paper, we propose a tool-supported approach that integrates the Goal-oriented Requirement Language and feature modeling to handle regulatory goal model families. We show how they can be organized as a Software Product Line (SPL), ensuring the consistency of the SPL as a whole, and providing an adapted derivation process associated to a feature model configuration. The proposed approach is also evaluated on large generated SPLs with results suggesting its capability to address scalability concerns.","2015","2025-03-26 12:56:47","2025-03-26 12:56:47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-19069-3_12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Results from the 342 unique studies covered by these reviews demonstrate that eight types of Information Technology artifacts are used in the design, execution and after-execution lifecycle phases of regulatory compliance to perform compliance modeling, checking, analysis and enactment tasks. The results also demonstrate with statistical evidence that compliance enactment (which involves putting mechanisms in place to address changes in the compliance representations, business processes or regulatory requirements) has received the least attention. This is a worrisome situation given the dynamic environment in which businesses operate. We argue that the findings in this work are relevant toward understanding the current state of the domain, providing insights on what phases and tasks need improvement.","2015","2025-03-26 12:56:47","2025-03-26 12:56:47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-17957-5_6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper proposes a technique to apply a formal technique to ensure the regulatory compliance of BP or IS descriptions written in use case models. We translate the use case models of the behavior of BPs and ISs into finite state transition machines.

During the same period, other researchers have worked on the development of argumentative techniques for software systems. We think that it would be interesting for the researchers belonging to these different communities to share their experiences and to develop systems that take advantage of the advances gained in each domain. We start by reviewing the evolution of explanation systems from the simple reasoning traces associated with early expert systems to recent research on interactive and collaborative explanations. We then discuss the characteristics of critiquing systems that test the credibility of the user's solution. The rest of the paper deals with the different application domains that use argumentative techniques. First, we discuss how argumentative reasoning can be captured by a general structure in which a given claim or conclusion is inferred from a set of data and how this argument structure relates to pragmatic knowledge, explanation production and practical reasoning. We discuss the role of argument in defeasible reasoning and present some works in the new field of computer-mediated defeasible argumentation. We review different application domains such as computer-mediated communication, design rationale, crisis management and knowledge management, in which argumentation support tools are used. We describe models in which arguments are associated to mental attitudes such as goals, plans and beliefs. We present recent advances in the application of argumentative techniques to multi-agent systems. Finally, we propose research perspectives for the integration of explanation and argumentation capabilities in knowledge-based systems and make suggestions for enhancing the argumentation and persuasion capabilities of software agents.","2002","2025-03-26 12:56:48","2025-03-26 12:56:48","","","","","","","Artificial Intelligence Review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1023/a:1015023512975","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the usability evaluation can take place in different forms, the entire evaluation procedure usually follows predefined ways according to a classification of the common characteristics of software applications. However, contemporary Web 2.0 applications, which aim at both social network development and collaboration support, reveal the need for modifying the settings of the evaluation procedure. This is due to some unique characteristics of these applications, such as the support of both synchronous and asynchronous collaboration, the use of common spaces for working and information exchanging, and the advanced notification and awareness services. This paper explores these applications’ particularities with respect to the way the whole usability evaluation procedure is affected and proposes a composite evaluation technique based on the development of appropriate heuristics that is suitable for such cases. The aforementioned issues are elaborated through the case of CoPe_it!, a Web 2.0 tool that facilitates and enhances argumentative collaboration.","2010","2025-03-26 12:56:48","2025-03-26 12:56:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-16318-0_28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However this cannot come at the price of control objectives which stem from various legislative, standard and business partnership sources. Ensuring the compliance to regulations and industrial standards is an increasingly important issue in the design of business processes. In this paper, we advocate that control objectives should be addressed at an early stage, i.e., design time, so as to minimize the problems of runtime compliance checking and consequent violations and penalties. To this aim, we propose supporting mechanisms for business process designers. This paper specifically presents a support method which allows the process designer to quantitatively measure the compliance degree of a given process model against a set of control objectives. This will allow process designers to comparatively assess the compliance degree of their design as well as be better informed on the cost of non-compliance.","2007","2025-03-26 12:56:48","2025-03-26 12:56:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-78238-4_14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"P5CW293H","journalArticle","1993","Janet L. Kolodner; Janet L. Kolodner","Case-based reasoning","","","","","","Case-based reasoning is one of the fastest growing areas in the field of knowledge-based systems and this book, authored by a leader in the field, is the first comprehensive text on the subject. Case-based reasoning systems are systems that store information about situations in their memory. As new problems arise, similar situations are searched out to help solve these problems. Problems are understood and inferences are made by finding the closest cases in memory, comparing and contrasting the problem with those cases, making inferences based on those comparisons, and asking questions when inferences can't be made. This book presents the state of the art in case-based reasoning. The author synthesizes and analyzes a broad range of approaches, with special emphasis on applying case-based reasoning to complex real-world problem-solving tasks such as medical diagnosis, design, conflict resolution, and planning. The author's approach combines cognitive science and engineering, and is based on analysis of both expert and common-sense tasks. Guidelines for building case-based expert systems are provided, such as how to represent knowledge in cases, how to index cases for accessibility, how to implement retrieval processes for efficiency, and how to adapt old solutions to fit new situations. This book is an excellent text for courses and tutorials on case-based reasoning. It is also a useful resource for computer professionals and cognitive scientists interested in learning more about this fast-growing field.","1993","2025-03-26 12:56:48","2025-03-26 12:56:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Case-based%20reasoning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An Introduction to the Law, Ethics and HIPAA Rule on Medical Privacy","Georgia State University law review","","","10.1385/1-59259-089-6:3","","After years of Congressional debates and agency rule-making, the HIPAA health care privacy rule has finally become effective. Why did it take so long? Many of the issues which deadlocked Congressional attempts to pass federal privacy legislation reflect deep disagreements over how much individual privacy should be protected. On one hand, patients often believe that no one except their closest health caregivers should be able to see their medical records without their permission. On the other hand, many other people and entities, mostly strangers to the patient, believe they should have access to those records without having to ask permission. They argue that such relatively free access to individual health care information is good for the patient, good for other patients, and good for society - in other words, that too much privacy protection is bad for our individual and collective health. Indeed, society has often tolerated sacrifices in individual medical privacy in order to promote the public good. This article examines the ethical trade-offs that we have made between the benefits of privacy protection and the benefits of sacrificing it in the name of social welfare, such as advances in scientific research, protection of the public health, higher efficiency and better quality in the delivery of health care, and even improved law enforcement. It analyzes how these ethical trade-offs have been reflected in our laws, Congressional debates, and recent HIPAA privacy rule. It also examines several key issues which created the impasse in enacting comprehensive federal legislation, and which continue to be controversial as providers face the task of compliance. The article serves as a guide for legal and health care professionals who would like to be introduced to what the controversy over health care privacy has been all about and how the HIPAA rule has, at least for the time being, resolved some aspects of it.","2000","2025-03-26 12:56:48","2025-03-26 12:56:48","","","","","","","Georgia State University law review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1385/1-59259-089-6:3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Classification is the topic of a dialogue game between two agents, based on an argument scheme and critical questions designed for use by agents whose knowledge of the domain comes from data mining. Each agent has its own set of examples which it can mine to find arguments based on association rules for and against a classification of a new instance. These arguments are exchanged in order to classify the instance. We describe the dialogue game, and in particular discuss the strategic considerations which agents can use to select their moves. Different strategies give rise to games with different characteristics, some having the flavour of persuasion dialogues and other deliberation dialogues.","2007","2025-03-26 12:56:48","2025-03-26 12:56:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-75256-1_42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper introduces a generalized definition of abstract argumentation framework called $\ensuremath{AFRA}$ (Argumentation Framework with Recursive Attacks), where an attack is allowed to be directed towards another attack. From a conceptual point of view, we claim that this generalization supports a straightforward representation of reasoning situations which are not easily accommodated within the traditional framework. From the technical side, we first investigate the extension to the generalized framework of the basic notions of conflict-free set, acceptable argument, admissible set and of Dung's fundamental lemma. Then we propose a correspondence from the $\ensuremath{AFRA}$ to the $\ensuremath{AF}$ formalism, showing that it satisfies some basic desirable properties. Finally we analyze the relationships between $\ensuremath{AFRA}$ and a similar extension of Dung's abstract argumentation framework, called $\ensuremath{EAF+}$ and derived from the recently proposed formalism $\ensuremath{EAF}$.","2009","2025-03-26 12:56:48","2025-03-26 12:56:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-02906-6_9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Gordon's work evaluates important jurisprudential theories of argumentation and reasoning in the context of the U.S. commercial law on secured transactions.

Natural language processing techniques have been applied to automatically build lexicons for each language. Lexical and conceptual multilingual alignment has been accomplished exploiting terms position in parallel documents. An ontology describing entities involved in the chosen domain has been developed in order to provide a semantic description of terms in lexicons.

A software development project is only considered to be truly agile if these values and principles are followed. However, software developed for use in medical devices must be regulatory compliant and this can make the process of following a single agile methodology such as XP difficult to achieve. This paper outlines how we identified the barriers to agile adoption in the medical device software domain through performing a survey. These barriers include: lack of documentation; maintaining traceability; regulatory compliance; lack of up front planning and the process of managing multiple releases. Based on this research recommendations are also made as to how these barriers can be overcome.","2012","2025-03-26 12:56:48","2025-03-26 12:56:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-30439-2_13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"CEP5BJVI","journalArticle","2010","S.W. van den Braak; S.W. van den Braak","Sensemaking software for crime analysis","","","","","","Criminal investigation is a difficult and laborious process that is prone to error as teams of investigators may be subject to tunnel vision, groupthink, and confirmation bias. As a result, miscarriages of justice may ensue. To overcome these problems, in the Dutch law enforcement organization, crime analysts have been given a more important role. It is now their task to critically evaluate the investigation that is going on. They have to make sense of the vast amount of evidence available in a case by generating plausible scenarios about what might have happened. Subsequently, they have to assess the quality of their scenarios and choose the best alternative. Due to the difficulty of this process, a great need exists for software that supports crime analysts in their task. However, current support tools for crime analysis do not allow analysts to record scenarios and their relation to the evidence and as a result the most important part of the analysis process remains in the analysts' minds. Therefore, they may benefit from so-called sensemaking systems that allow them to make their reasoning process explicit by visualizing scenarios and the reasons why these scenarios are supported by the evidence. Nevertheless, such sensemaking tools for crime analysis are relatively sparse and often do not incorporate a logical model of reasoning with evidence in the context of crime analysis. This thesis aims to fill this gap by proposing sensemaking software that has specifically been designed for crime analysis. Such a tool should be rationally well-founded, natural, useful, usable, and effective. To this aid, a proof-of-concept application called AVERs (Argument Visualization for Evidential Reasoning based on stories) was built that implements a rationally well-founded and natural model of the reasoning that takes place in crime analysis. In this way a standard of rational reasoning is encouraged and errors may be reduced. Using AVERs analysts are able to create visual representations of scenarios and evidential arguments. Scenarios are represented as causal networks of events, while evidential arguments are arguments based on the evidential data in the case. Such arguments are based on argumentation schemes that often come with critical questions. These questions make the analysts more aware of possible sources of doubt and encourage them to critically examine the evidence. Evidential arguments can be used to support or attack scenarios with the available evidence. In this way, this software allows the analysts to reason about scenarios and to critically evaluate them. Moreover, it provides features that can be used to compare alternative scenarios. A series of empirical studies has confirmed that the design and implementation of AVERs fulfills all five criteria to a certain degree. This means that it is useful to crime analysts and satisfies their desires, while it may improve their analysis of the case and the communication of their results to the investigators working on the case, and ensures that rational analyses are performed. Therefore, through this software in the future biases in the crime analysis process may be avoided.","2010","2025-03-26 12:56:49","2025-03-26 12:56:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Sensemaking%20software%20for%20crime%20analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It encompasses two comlementary strategies. On the one hand, there is the top–down definition of the conceptual structure of the legal domain under consideration on the basis of expert jugdment. This structure is language–independent, modeled as an ontology, and can be aligned with other ontologies that capture similar or complementary knowledge, in order to provide a wider conceptual embedding. Another top–down approach is the exploitation of the explicit structure of legal texts, which enables the targeted identification of text spans that play an ontological role and their subsequent inclusion in the knowledge model. On the other hand, the linguistically motivated, text-based bottom–up population and incremental refinement of this conceptual structure using (semi-)automatic NLP techniques, maximizes the completeness and domain-specificity of the resulting knowledge. The proposed methodology is concerned with the relation between these two differently derived types of knowledge, and defines a framework for interfacing lexical and ontological knowledge, the result of which offers various perspectives on multilingual legal knowledge. Two case-studies combining bottom-up and top-down methodologies for knowledge modelling and learning are presented as illustrations of the methodology.","2010","2025-03-26 12:56:49","2025-03-26 12:56:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-12837-0_6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ability to characterise the nature and origins of requirements change during software development is important and can lead organisations towards more effective management of changing requirements. This work focuses on a study to establish how practitioners classify requirements change requests. We used the card sorting method to identify categories of change requests that software developers use in practice. Card sorting is a knowledge elicitation method that is commonly used for capturing information about different ways of representing domain knowledge. This study has allowed us to get valuable insights into the way practitioners classify change requests and to understand their perspectives on classification. This classification is a valuable source of information in prioritizing change requests and assessing their impact. Our findings from the card sorting exercise further reveal that the criteria used for categorization are related to the role the practitioner plays in the software development team and the nature and extent of their responsibilities.","2004","2025-03-26 12:56:49","2025-03-26 12:56:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/re.2004.55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Central in such formalisms is a notion of argument. Arguments are formal reconstructions of how a conclusion is supported. Generally, an argument is defeasible.

Some sample di- alogues are analyzed with arguments from expert opinion, revealing that some critical questions of this scheme carry with them a burden of proof on the questioner while others do not, and that the burden of proof can become the subject of debate during a dialogue. Then these dialogues are diagrammed with the argument visualization software Araucaria, and a simple formal protocol is proposed of persuasion dialogues with embedded burden-of-proof dialogues. The objective of this paper is to analyze the phenomenon of a shift of the burden of proof in persuasion dialogues where arguments are constructed according to argumentation schemes. Suppose an argu- ment instantiating some scheme has been put forward and a criti- cal question matching the scheme for that argument has been asked. Does merely asking the question make the argument default, or is the burden on the questioner to provide evidence? In this paper we take the view that the answer to this question depends on domain-specific issues and that the domain context in which the dialogue takes place will often leave room for disagreement on allocations of the burden of proof. Accordingly, our aim is to present a protocol for two-person persuasion dialogues in which the burden of proof can become the issue under dispute. In developing our model, we will first analyze some sample dialogues using the argumentation scheme from expert opinion, then semiformally diagram these dialogues with the argu- ment visualization software Araucaria (10), and finally present a for- mal protocol.

As in all federal systems, the distribution of powers between central and state governments poses problems for national consistency.

For a company with a big family of safety-related products and a great number of development projects like ABB, it would be very time-consuming and cost-intensive for each safety development project to develop a safety lifecycle model. One approach for managing the corresponding costs and effort is to create a common lifecycle model that fulfills the SIL requirements and can be reused by safety-related projects. In this paper we are going to present such a common safety lifecycle model, its structure and components, and our experience on how to establish and apply it in safety-related product development projects. The paper analyzes the design constraints for the development of a common safety lifecycle model such as complexity, flexibility, simplicity, conformity and the safety integrity. It shows how these constraints drive the design of the safety lifecycle model to be developed.

It shows how asking what are the arguments and what are the forms of argumentation that we believe would be accepted by such an audience is a useful analytical tool. The book explores what, if any, are the constraints that our vision of an ideal audience imposes on public discourse and particularly on legal discourse. Some visions of an ideal or universal audience are widely shared; others are only shared within particular political and legal cultures. Stylistic preferences can have as important an influence on legal decision making as do substantive preferences. In some cultures and legal systems there is a preference for resort to broad general principles; in others there is a preference for a more circumscribed and particular mode of legal argument. Different legal cultures have different idealized notions as to the role of the judge and these different conceptions of the role of the judge will influence many aspects of legal decision making, including how statutes and other authoritative official instruments should be interpreted. The book also illustrates, by concrete examples, how the resolution of all these questions will be influenced by how a particular legal culture envisions the common or public good and by how tolerant a particular legal culture is of diverse outcomes, that is by how much discretion superior legal decision makers are prepared to grant inferior decision makers.","2000","2025-03-26 12:56:49","2025-03-26 12:56:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=The%20Notion%20of%20an%20Ideal%20Audience%20in%20Legal%20Argument","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A mixed approach, using linguistic information and machine learning techniques, is described in this paper. In this approach, top-level legal concepts are identified and used for document classification using Support Vector Machines. Named entities, such as, locations, organizations, dates, and document references, are identified using semantic information from the output of a natural language parser. This information, legal concepts and named entities, may be used to populate a simple ontology, allowing the enrichment of documents and the creation of high-level legal information retrieval systems. The proposed methodology was applied to a corpus of legal documents - from the EUR-Lex site – and it was evaluated. The obtained results were quite good and indicate this may be a promising approach to the legal information extraction problem.","2010","2025-03-26 12:56:49","2025-03-26 12:56:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-12837-0_3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We argue that not only can contradictions be tolerated, but in fact they are useful. An excellent test of an argument is to compare it with the best argument for the opposing view. Accordingly, we propose a multilevel architecture, where the object level may include contradictory rules, and the metalevels resolve these conflicts. Once such an architecture exists, there are advantages to allowing contradictions in wider contexts. In a legal context we may want to examine both sides of an argument. In administrative applications, we may need systems that ‘look over a clerk's shoulder’ to check that he is following one of several plausible, but not necessarily compatible, approaches. We are currently implementing these ideas.","1993","2025-03-26 12:56:49","2025-03-26 12:56:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/3-540-57234-1_51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bench-Capon; Henry Prakken; Henry Prakken; Giovanni Sartor; Giovanni Sartor","Argumentation in Legal Reasoning","","","","10.1007/978-0-387-98197-0_18","","A popular view of what Artificial Intelligence can do for lawyers is that it can do no more than deduce the consequences from a precisely stated set of facts and legal rules. This immediately makes many lawyers sceptical about the usefulness of such systems: this mechanical approach seems to leave out most of what is important in legal reasoning. A case does not appear as a set of facts, but rather as a story told by a client. For example, a man may come to his lawyer saying that he had developed an innovative product while working for Company A. Now Company B has made him an offer of a job, to develop a similar product for them. Can he do this? The lawyer firstly must interpret this story, in the context, so that it can be made to fit the framework of applicable law. Several interpretations may be possible. In our example it could be seen as being governed by his contract of employment, or as an issue in Trade Secrets law. Next the legal issues must be identified and the pros and cons of the various interpretations considered with respect to them. Does his contract include a non-disclosure agreement? If so, what are its terms? Was he the sole developer of the product? Did Company A support its development? Does the product use commonly known techniques? Did Company A take measures to protect the secret? Some of these will favour the client, some the Company. Each interpretation will require further facts to be obtained. For example, do the facts support a claim that the employee was the sole developer of the product? Was development work carried out in his spare time? What is the precise nature of the agreements entered into? Once an interpretation has been selected, the argument must be organised into the form considered most likely to persuade, both to advocate the client’s position and to rebut anticipated objections. Some precedents may point to one result and others to another. In that case, further arguments may be produced to suggest following the favourable precedent and ignoring the unfavourable one. Or the rhetorical presentation of the facts may prompt one interpretation rather than the other. Surely all this requires the skill, experience and judgement of a human being? Granted that this is true, much effort has been made to design computer programs that will help people in these tasks, and it is the purpose of this chapter to describe the progress that has been made in modelling and supporting this kind of sophisticated legal reasoning.We will review systems that can store conflicting interpretations and that can propose alternative solutions to a case based on these interpretations. We will also describe systems that can use legal precedents to generate arguments by drawing analogies to or distinguishing precedents. We will discuss systems that can argue why a rule should not be applied to a case even though all its conditions are met. Then there are systems that can act as a mediator between disputing parties by structuring and recording their arguments and responses. Finally we look at systems that suggest mechanisms and tactics for forming arguments.","2009","2025-03-26 12:56:49","2025-03-26 12:56:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-98197-0_18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Requirements are located in the environment, which is distinguished from the machine to be built. A requirement is a condition over phenomena of the environment. A specification is a restricted form of requirement, providing enough information for the implementer to build the machine (by programming it) without further environment knowledge. To describe requirements appropriately we must fit our descriptions into an appropriate structure. This structure must respect the distinction between the machine and the environment, and the distinction between those environment properties that are given (indicative descriptions) and those that must be achieved by the machine (optative descriptions). Formalisation is a fundamental problem of requirements engineering. Since most environments are parts of the physical world, and therefore informal, the formalisation task is inescapable. Some techniques are discussed for tackling this task. In particular, the use of designations is explained, and the distinction between definition and assertion. By using the smallest possible set of designated terms, augmented by appropriate definitions, the developer can create a narrow bridge between the environment and its descriptions in the requirements. In this way a sufficiently faithful approximation to the informal reality can be obtained.","1997","2025-03-26 12:56:49","2025-03-26 12:56:49","","","","","","","Annals of Software Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1023/a:1018990005598","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is also argued that estandardi argumentation logics for AI must be adapted in order to model shifts in burdens of proof. Thus this analysis illustrates in two ways that logics cannot be simply imposed on the law but that features of legal systems must be taken into account. First there is the claim that the burden of persuasion, which legally is the burden to prove a statement to a specified degree (the standard of proof) on the penalty of losing on the issue, can be verified by applying an argumentation logic to the evidence available at the final stage of a proceeding. Then a precise distinction is made between two burdens that are sometimes confused, namely the burden of production and the tactical burden. In this analysis, the tactical burden of proof is automatically induced by the defeasible nature of the reasoning. The burden of production, by contrast, concerns the legal question whether an issue can be submitted to trial or must be decided as a matter of law against the one who fails to produce any evidence. Finally the issue is raised to what extent this account can be generalised to statistical and story-based approaches.","2010","2025-03-26 12:56:50","2025-03-26 12:56:50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=A%20logical%20analysis%20of%20burdens%20of%20proof","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We discuss some dimensions in which to distinguish types of ontologies, for example considering their level of structure. We propose five main roles of ontologies in general: (a) organize and structure information; (b) reasoning and problem solving; (c) se-mantic indexing and search; (d) semantics integration and interoperation; and (e) understanding the domain. We then discuss example of works that have exploited each of these roles in the AI and Law literature. Further, we discuss some of the consequences of using ontologies to play each of these roles in terms of the level of structure of the knowledge represented in the ontologies, the kinds of knowledge representation formalisms they use, and the reasoning methods they employ.","2005","2025-03-26 12:56:50","2025-03-26 12:56:50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-32253-5_5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is because of the lack of guidelines and tools that facilitate derivation of processes from contracts but also because of the traditional mindset of treating contracts separately from business processes. This chapter will provide a solution to one specific problem that arises from this situation, namely the lack of mechanisms to check whether business processes are compliant with business contracts. The chapter begins by defining the space for business process compliance and the eco-system for ensuring that process are compliant. The key point is that compliance is a relationship between two sets of specifications: the specifications for executing a business process and the specifications regulating a business. The central part of the chapter focuses on a logic based formalism for describing both the semantics of normative specifications and the semantics of compliance checking procedures.","2009","2025-03-26 12:56:50","2025-03-26 12:56:50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.4018/978-1-60566-288-6.ch020","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Today, they are arguably a legal necessity--at least for public companies with a presence in the United States. But the issue goes beyond U.S. legal and regulatory requirements. Sparked by corruption and excess of various types, dozens of industry, government, investor, and multisector groups worldwide have proposed codes and guidelines to govern corporate behavior. These initiatives reflect an increasingly global debate on the nature of corporate legitimacy. Given the legal, organizational, reputational, and strategic considerations, few companies will want to be without a code. But what should it say? Apart from a handful of essentials spelled out in Sarbanes-Oxley regulations and NYSE rules, authoritative guidance is sorely lacking. In search of some reference points for managers, the authors undertook a systematic analysis of a select group of codes. In this article, they present their findings in the form of a ""codex,"" a reference source on code content. The Global Business Standards Codex contains a set of overarching principles as well as a set of conduct standards for putting those principles into practice. The GBS Codex is not intended to be adopted as is, but is meant to be used as a benchmark by those wishing to create their own world-class code. The provisions of the codex must be customized to a company's specific business and situation; individual companies' codes will include their own distinctive elements as well. What the codex provides is a starting point grounded in ethical fundamentals and aligned with an emerging global consensus on basic standards of corporate behavior.","2005","2025-03-26 12:56:50","2025-03-26 12:56:50","","","","","","","Harvard Business Review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16334587","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its aim is to automatically summarise Belgian criminal cases in order to improve access to the large number of existing and future cases. Therefore, techniques are developed for identifying and extracting relevant information from the cases. A broader application of these techniques could considerably simplify the work of the legal profession. A double methodology was used when developing SALOMON: the cases are processed by employing additional knowledge to interpret structural patterns and features on the one hand and by way of occurrence statistics of index terms on the other. As a result, SALOMON performs an initial categorisation and structuring of the cases and subsequently extracts the most relevant text units of the alleged offences and of the opinion of the court.

This study presents a broad perspective on logic by focusing on inference not just in isolation but as embedded in contexts of procedure and investigation. With special attention being paid to recent developments in Artificial Intelligence and the Law, specifically related to evidentiary reasoning, this book provides clarification of problems of logic and argumentation in relation to evidence and proof. As the vast majority of legal conflicts relate to contested facts, rather than contested law, this volume concerning facts as prime determinants of legal decisions presents an important contribution to the field for both scholars and practitioners.

The aim of our work has therefore been to describe the key factors causing lack of trust, and the main effects of lacking trust in such teams. From studying 4 projects, all located in two different countries, with trust problems we found the key factors to be poor socialization and socio-cultural fit, lack of face-to-face meetings, missing conflict handling and cognitive based trust, increased monitoring and too little communication. The effect of lacking trust was a decrease in productivity, quality, information exchange, feedback and morale among the employees; the monitoring increased and the employees doubted negative feedback from manager.","2007","2025-03-26 12:56:50","2025-03-26 12:56:50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-73460-4_6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, finding the right measures to evaluate and track compliance is very challenging. We propose a novel method to model the context and measure compliance using the User Requirements Notation (URN). We mainly use Key Performance Indicator (KPI) extensions of URN to measure the level of compliance to rules. Such KPIs have been used in the past to measure the satisfaction level of goals and the performance of business processes. Yet, they have never been used for measuring compliance. Our method highlights the non-compliant policies and rules on a quadrant map based on their importance and compliance levels. Furthermore, we suggest a new method for importance calculation in this context. We use a human resource policy example to illustrate our method.","2010","2025-03-26 12:56:50","2025-03-26 12:56:50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-20511-8_7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The thesaurus takes into account the necessary degree of formalism of legal language and therefore overcomes the untidiness of natural language and represents automatically the expert knowledge of a lawyer about legal terminology.

Monitoring systems for requirements and policy compliance has been recognized in the requirements engineering community as a key area for research. Similarly, legal compliance is critical in systems development, especially given that non-compliance can result in both financial and criminal penalties. Working with legal texts can be very challenging, however, because they contain numerous ambiguities, cross-references, domain-specific definitions, and acronyms, and are frequently amended via new statutes, regulations, and case law. Requirements engineers and compliance auditors must be able to identify relevant legal texts, extract requirements and other key concepts, and monitor compliance. This chapter surveys research efforts over the past 50 years in handling legal texts for systems development. This survey can aid requirements engineers and auditors to better specify, test, and monitor systems for compliance.","2009","2025-03-26 12:56:50","2025-03-26 12:56:50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-92966-6_21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The last five years have seen an explosion in XML schemas and DTDs whose focus in modelling legal resources their focus was on structure. Now that the basic elements of textual descriptiveness are well formalized, we can use this knowledge to proceed with content. This paper presents a detailed methodology for classifying modificatory provisions in depth and providing all the necessary information for semiautomatically managing the consolidation process. The methodology is based on an empirical legal analysis of about 29,000 Italian acts, where we bring out regularities in the language associated with some modifications, and where we define patterns of proprieties for each type of modificatory provision. The list of verbs and the frames inferred through this empirical legal analysis have been used by the NLP group at the University of Turin to refine a syntactical NLP parser for isolating and representing the sentences as syntactic trees, and the pattern will be used by the light semantic interpreter module to indentify the parameters of modificatory provisions.","2009","2025-03-26 12:56:51","2025-03-26 12:56:51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-16524-5_5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Tools and methodologies implemented in the SEKT project are employed and optimized in three case studies, one of them being concerned with intelligent integrated decision support for legal professionals. The main goal of this case study is to offer decision support to newly appointed judges in Spain by means of iFAQ, an intelligent Frequently Asked Questions system based on a complex ontology of the legal domain. Building this ontology is a tedious and time-consuming task requiring profound knowledge of legal documents and language. Therefore, any kind of automatic support can significantly increase the efficiency of the knowledge acquisition process. In this paper we present Text2Onto, an open-source tool for ontology learning, and our experiments with legal case study data. The previously existing English version of Text2Onto has been adapted to support the linguistic analysis of Spanish texts, including language-specific algorithms for the extraction of ontological concepts, instances and relations. Text2Onto greatly facilitated the automatic generation of the initial version of the Spanish legal ontology from a given collection of Spanish documents. In further iterative steps which included a mixture of learning and manual effort the ontology has been refined and applied to the real-world case study.","2008","2025-03-26 12:56:51","2025-03-26 12:56:51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-85569-9_7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The study described in this article examined the way in which 10 legal experts (8 lawyers and 2 judges) and 10 novices (law students in the top 50% of their class) read a judicial opinion. Whereas the experts read efficiently (taking less overall time), the beginning law students read less efficiently. Where the experts read the text flexibly, moving back and forth between different parts of the opinion, the novices read inflexibly. The experts connected to the purpose of their reading more consistently than the novices and drew upon their prior knowledge and experience with the law. The results of this study suggest that we can give our students the following advice in order to read like legal experts: (1) Read with a purpose; (2) Use background knowledge to situate the case; (3) Establish the context of the case before beginning to read; (4) Evaluate the case and have an opinion about its outcome; and (5) Read flexibly; skim and skip when appropriate. By examining the actual transcripts of lawyers and judges reading a case, this article illustrates how we can teach our students to read like legal experts.

Attempts to broaden the class of relationships include bipolar frameworks, where arguments support others, and abstract dialectical frameworks (ADFs). The latter, allow ""acceptance"" of an argument, x, to be predicated on a given propositional function, Cx, dependent on the corresponding acceptance of its parents, i.e. those y for which 〈y, x〉 occurs. Although offering a richly expressive formalism subsuming both standard and bipolar AFs, an issue that arises with ADFs is whether this expressiveness is achieved in a manner that would be infeasible within standard AFs. Can the semantics used in ADFs be mapped to some AF semantics? How many arguments are needed in an AF to ""simulate"" an ADF? We show that (in a formally defined sense) any ADF can be simulated by an AF of similar size and that this translation can be realised by a polynomial time algorithm.","2011","2025-03-26 12:56:51","2025-03-26 12:56:51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.5591/978-1-57735-516-8/ijcai11-137","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper we present two core ontologies for law. The first one was the result of a PhD thesis by [Valente, 1995], called FOLaw. FOLaw speci- fies functional dependencies between types of knowledge involved in legal reasoning. Despite the fact that FOLaw was the starting point for a number of ontologies and legal reasoning systems in various (European) projects, it is rather an epistemological framework than a (core) ontology. We are not the only ones who easily confound epistemology with ontology. In the paper we present some examples and discuss whether this epistemological promiscuity in (core) ontology development is a serious problem. It is to some extent, as it limits the scope of re-use (if not leading to confusion). Therefore, we started about four years ago the development of a 'real' core-ontology for law based upon notions of common sense. The reason for a common-sense foundation is that domain independent concepts of law - the common denominator - are still tainted with a strong common-sense flavor. Moreover, domains of law refer to social activities which are generally governed by common-sense notions. This core ontology, called LRI-Core, consists of five major portions ('worlds'): physical, mental and abstract classes; roles and occurrences.","2004","2025-03-26 12:56:51","2025-03-26 12:56:51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Epistemology%20and%20ontology%20in%20core%20ontologies:%20FOLaw%20and%20LRI-Core,%20two%20core%20ontologies%20for%20law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The former are elicited from customers while the latter are brought forth by the developing organization. These are preferably kept separated to preserve the different perspectives. The interrelationships should however be identified and maintained to enable well-founded decisions. Unfortunately, the current manual linkage is cumbersome, time-consuming, and error-prone. This work presents a pragmatic linguistic engineering approach to how statistical natural language processing may be used to support the manual linkage between customer wishes and product requirements by suggesting potential links. An evaluation with real requirements from industry is presented. It shows that in a realistic setting, automatic support could make linkage faster for at least 50% of the links.

Aligning control objectives that stem from regulations and legislation with business objectives devised for improved business performance is a foremost challenge. The organizational as well as IT structures for the two classes of objectives are often distinct and potentially in conflict. In this chapter, we present an overarching methodology for aligning business and control objectives. The various phases of the methodology are then used as a basis for discussing state-of-the-art in compliance management.

Deviations may be costly and expose an organization to severe risks. Compliance checking is of growing importance for the business process management and auditing communities. This paper presents an approach for checking compliance of observed process executions recorded in an event log to temporal compliance requirements, which restrict when particular activities may or may not occur. We show how temporal compliance requirements discussed in literature can be unified and formalized using a generic temporal compliance rule. To check compliance with respect to a temporal rule, the event log describing the observed behavior is aligned with the rule. The alignment then shows which events occurred out of order and which events deviated by which amount of time from the prescribed behavior. This approach integrates with an existing approach for control-flow compliance checking, allowing for multi-perspective diagnostic information in case of compliance violations. We show the feasibility of our technique by checking temporal compliance rules of real life event logs.","2013","2025-03-26 12:56:51","2025-03-26 12:56:51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-38709-8_20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is argued that the two currently available modelling approaches both have some shortcomings. On the one hand, techniques for modelling burden of proof in nonmonotonic logics do not allow for shifts of the burden of proof from one party to the other. On the other hand, current procedural models of legal argument are too rigid, in that every counterargument induces a shift of proof burdens; this fails to respect that in legal reasoning burden shifts only occur in some cases.

"U4HN39ZX","journalArticle","2001","John R. Searle; Francois Recanati; John R. Searle","Rationality in Action","","","","","","The study of rationality and practical reason, or rationality in action, has been central to Western intellectual culture. In this invigorating book, John Searle lays out six claims of what he calls the Classical Model of rationality and shows why they are false. He then presents an alternative theory of the role of rationality in thought and action. A central point of Searle's theory is that only irrational actions are directly caused by beliefs and desires -- for example, the actions of a person in the grip of an obsession or addiction. In most cases of rational action, there is a gap between the motivating desire and the actual decision making. The traditional name for this gap is ""freedom of the will."" According to Searle, all rational activity presupposes free will. For rationality is possible only where one has a choice among various rational as well as irrational options. Unlike many philosophical tracts, Rationality in Action invites the reader to apply the author's ideas to everyday life. Searle shows, for example, that contrary to the traditional philosophical view, weakness of will is very common. He also points out the absurdity of the claim that rational decision making always starts from a consistent set of desires. Rational decision making, he argues, is often about choosing between conflicting reasons for action. In fact, humans are distinguished by their ability to be rationally motivated by desire-independent reasons for action. Extending his theory of rationality to the self, Searle shows how rational deliberation presupposes an irreducible notion of the self. He also reveals the idea of free will to be essentially a thesis of how the brain works.","2001","2025-03-26 12:56:51","2025-03-26 12:56:51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Rationality%20in%20Action","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The framework continuously verifies compliance with respect to a predefined constraint model. Our approach is able to provide meaningful diagnostics even after a constraint is violated. This is important as in reality people and organizations will deviate and in many situations it is not desirable or even impossible to circumvent constraint violations. As demonstrated in this paper, there are several approaches to recover after the first constraint violation. Traditional approaches that simply check constraints are unable to recover after the first violation and still foresee (inevitable) future violations.

Most of the research reported concerns results from mid-size (European) projects aimed at the development of legal reasoning and information management tools and systems. In these projects we developed ontologies for several legal or regulation domains. However, the main thread of this article is provided by fundamental research performed by us or under our supervision (e.g. PhD theses by [1], [2], [3]), leading to more abstract legal ‘core' ontologies and legal reasoning architectures. The major insights we have obtained from these experiences can be summarized as follows: Legal sources contain and assume non-legal, common-sense based domain knowledge. Therefore, a legal core ontology should be rooted in highly abstract common sense concepts as a foundational ontology. This notion is worked out in the LRI-Core ontology, presented in this article. What remains as typical legal knowledge to be modelled is normative and legal responsability knowledge. However, in this article we only summarize our work in this area, refering to [4] and to [5] on these issues. As law and legal theory is focussed on questions of justification, legal (core) ontologies, e.g. FOLaw, are epistemological frameworks, describing legal reasoning, rather than legal ontologies, explaining knowledge resources.","2005","2025-03-26 12:56:51","2025-03-26 12:56:51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-32253-5_4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If the case at hand is analogous to a settled case, then by judicial authority one can argue that the settled case should be followed. Case-based reasoning is a topic where ontology meets logic since one’s conception of cases determines one’s conception of reasoning with cases. In the paper, it is shown how reasoning with cases can be modelled by comparing the corresponding dialectical arguments. A unique characteristic thereby is the explicit recognition that it is in principle contingent which case features are relevant for case comparison. This contigency gives rise to some typical reasoning patterns. The present work is compared to other existing approaches to reasoning by case comparison, and some work on legal ontologies is briefly discussed regarding the role attributed to cases.","2004","2025-03-26 12:56:51","2025-03-26 12:56:51","","","","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-30470-8_75","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"LGF7ID9C","journalArticle","2006","Daniel Jackson","Software Abstractions: Logic, Language, and Analysis","","","","","","In Software Abstractions Daniel Jackson introduces an approach to software design that draws on traditional formal methods but exploits automated tools to find flaws as early as possible. This approach--which Jackson calls ""lightweight formal methods"" or ""agile modeling""--takes from formal specification the idea of a precise and expressive notation based on a tiny core of simple and robust concepts but replaces conventional analysis based on theorem proving with a fully automated analysis that gives designers immediate feedback. Jackson has developed Alloy, a language that captures the essence of software abstractions simply and succinctly, using a minimal toolkit of mathematical notions. This revised edition updates the text, examples, and appendixes to be fully compatible with the latest version of Alloy (Alloy 4). The designer can use automated analysis not only to correct errors but also to make models that are more precise and elegant. This approach, Jackson says, can rescue designers from ""the tarpit of implementation technologies"" and return them to thinking deeply about underlying concepts. Software Abstractions introduces the key elements: a logic, which provides the building blocks of the language; a language, which adds a small amount of syntax to the logic for structuring descriptions; and an analysis, a form of constraint solving that offers both simulation (generating sample states and executions) and checking (finding counterexamples to claimed properties).","2006","2025-03-26 12:56:51","2025-03-26 12:56:51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Software%20Abstractions:%20Logic,%20Language,%20and%20Analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the one hand, the notion of bipolarity relies on the presence of two kinds of entities that have a diametrically opposed nature and that represent repellent forces (a positive entity and a negative entity). The notion exists in various domains (for example with the representation of preferences in artificial intelligence, or in cognitive psychology). On the other hand, argumentation process is a promising approach for reasoning, based on the construction and the comparison of arguments. It follows five steps: building the arguments, defining the interactions between these arguments, valuating the arguments, selecting the most acceptable arguments and, finally, drawing a conclusion. Using the nomenclature proposed by Dubois and Prade, this article shows on various applications, and with some formal definitions, that bipolarity appears in argumentation (in some cases if not always) and can be used in each step of this process under different forms. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","2008","2025-03-26 12:56:51","2025-03-26 12:56:51","","","","","","","International Journal of Intelligent Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1002/int.v23:10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper investigates and compares three term-based enhancement methods that are designed to improve the performance of a probabilistic automated tracing tool. Empirical studies show that the enhancement methods can be effective in increasing the accuracy of the retrieved traces; however the effectiveness of each method varies according to specific project characteristics. The analysis of such characteristics has lead to the development of two new project-level metrics which can be used to predict the effectiveness of each enhancement method for a given data set. A procedure to automatically extract critical keywords and phrases from a set of traceable artifacts is also presented to enhance the automated trace retrieval algorithm.

Increased understanding of the causes and consequences of change can support requirements management and also make progress towards the goal of change anticipation. This paper presents the results of two case studies that address objectives arising from that ultimate goal. The first case study evaluated the potential of a change source taxonomy containing the elements ‘market’, ‘organisation’, ‘vision’, ‘specification’, and ‘solution’ to provide a meaningful basis for change classification and measurement. The second case study investigated whether the requirements attributes of novelty, complexity, and dependency correlated with requirements volatility. While insufficiency of data in the first case study precluded an investigation of changes arising due to the change source of ‘market’, for the remainder of the change sources, results indicate a significant difference in cost, value to the customer and management considerations. Findings show that higher cost and value changes arose more often from ‘organisation’ and ‘vision’ sources; these changes also generally involved the co-operation of more stakeholder groups and were considered to be less controllable than changes arising from the ‘specification’ or ‘solution’ sources. Results from the second case study indicate that only ‘requirements dependency’ is consistently correlated with volatility and that changes coming from each change source affect different groups of requirements. We conclude that the taxonomy can provide a meaningful means of change classification, but that a single requirement attribute is insufficient for change prediction. A theoretical causal account of requirements change is drawn from the implications of the combined results of the two case studies.","2012","2025-03-26 12:56:52","2025-03-26 12:56:52","","","","","","","Requirements Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-012-0149-0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Software engineering research has typically focused on the development process, starting with user requirements—if that—with business modeling often confused with software system modeling [Isoda 2001]. Researchers and practitioners in management information systems have long recognized that understanding the business processes that an information system must support is key to eliciting the needs of its users (see e.g., Eriksson and Penker 2000]), but lacked the tools to model such business processes or to relate such models to software requirements. Researchers and practitioners in business administration have long been interested in modeling the processes of organizations for the purposes of understanding, analyzing, and improving such processes [Hammer and Champy 1993], but their models were often too coarse to be of use to software engineers. The advent of ecommerce and workflow management systems, among other things, has led to a convergence of interests and tools, within the broad IT community, for modeling and enabling business processes.

Ashley","What law students need to know to WIN","","","","10.1145/158976.158995","","To make legal arguments, one needs certain information about how to use cases effectively - dialectical information. In the broadest sense, dialectical information includes strategies for employing cases to justify legal conclusions (and responding to such justifications) and criteria for finding cases and deciding which cases to use. Making dialectical information explicit is important for teaching case-based argument. It is our experience that typically, law students do not have a very good set of dialectical strategies nor are they aware of the criteria. Even the most sophisticated legal information retrieval tools do not make such dialectical information explicit and assume that users have already learned it.  For purposes of instruction, we have identified some useful dialectical information comprising a flexible argument plan, a set of eight argument moves that embody standard ways for using cases as examples in an argument, factors for representing factual strengths and weaknesses in cases, and an annotated Claim Lattice for organizing cases for the purpose of selecting and making argument moves to implement the plan. Our tutorial program CATO makes this dialectical information explicit through a combination of information retrieval tools and graphical display. In this paper, an extended example illustrated the utility, for an expert, of this dialectical information for constructing a sophisticated legal argument from the argument moves. We believe that practice with the CATO program will make students aware of the existence of argumentative strategies and criteria and help them to apply this dialectical information to construct better arguments.","1993","2025-03-26 12:56:52","2025-03-26 12:56:52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1145/158976.158995","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It involves the integration of hardware, software, products, services, processes, and humans. The ever-increasing scale of complexity of systems and its impact on the business requires that we revisit the processes involved in the development and integration of a system. This paper proposes a Systems Integration Process Model (SIPM) based on a comprehensive lifecycle view of systems integration. As part of the ongoing SI research at Stevens Institute of Technology, the authors have developed a Systems Integration Framework (SIF) which incorporates the relevant aspects of integration from a lifecycle perspective and sets a foundation to an end-to-end approach to SI. Our end-to-end approach focuses on how integration issues can be addressed up-front to minimize integration related complexities and challenges later on in the system engineering process. This paper discusses the merits and benefits of applying the SIPM to evaluate and improve current SI processes in organizations. The paper provides, in addition to an overview of the SI framework, the activities included in the model. The model was pilot tested to evaluate the SI processes at a government agency.

However, as regulators in many domains increasingly look to move from prescriptive regulations towards more outcome-based regulations, the use of performance modeling will become more common place. The major difference of outcome-based regulations over prescriptive regulations is that the main interest lies in specifying clear objectives of the regulations and measuring whether regulated parties achieve these objectives, while leaving much freedom to the regulated party on how to meet these objectives. Recently, we have found that the use of performance modeling provides benefits such as revealing inconsistencies and lack of clarity in existing regulatory language. In this paper, we report on these experiences, summarize guidelines for the modeling of regulations, and examine whether the current drafting processes for regulations are optimized to take advantage of these additional benefits. We explore the advantages and disadvantages of various ways of augmenting the current approach with goal-oriented modeling of regulations. Based on our experience with Aviation Security regulations, we believe it is time for modeling to play a new role in helping to guide the drafting of regulations.","2012","2025-03-26 12:56:52","2025-03-26 12:56:52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/relaw.2012.6347802","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the set of generated traces is generally quite imprecise and must be manually evaluated by analysts. In applied settings when the retrieval algorithm is unable to find the relevant links for a given query, a human user can improve the trace results by manually adding additional search terms and filtering out unhelpful ones. However, the effectiveness of this approach is largely dependent upon the knowledge of the user. In this paper we present an automated technique for replacing the original query with a new set of query terms. These query terms are learned through seeding a web-based search with the original query and then processing the results to identify a set of domain-specific terms. The query-mining algorithm was evaluated and fine-tuned using security regulations from the USA government's Health Insurance Privacy and Portability Act (HIPAA) traced against ten healthcare related requirements specifications.","2010","2025-03-26 12:56:52","2025-03-26 12:56:52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1145/1858996.1859046","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, two broadly defined competing approaches, the traditional “waterfall” approach and iterative and incremental development (IID), are compared with regards to development cost and duration, and resulting product quality. The method used for this comparison is a systematic literature review. The small set of studies we located did not demonstrate any identifiable cost, duration, or quality trends, although there was some evidence suggesting the superiority of IID (in particular XP). The results of this review indicate that further empirical studies, both quantitative and qualitative, on this topic need to be undertaken.

To cope with such an environment, it is moving from a traditional evolutionary to a systems engineering approach. Great effort is being made for a shift from the traditional component focus, which has been enhanced by concurrent engineering, to a more broadened view supported by systems thinking. This broader view, however, is in practice strongly focused on the product elements of the system. This paper proposes a systems engineering framework for integrated automotive development—the total view approach. It is a modeling framework that integrates the product, its life cycle processes and their associated organizations throughout the requirements, functional and physical analysis processes, at all levels of the product breakdown structure, deriving attributes as emergent properties of a whole integrated system. The paper justifies the framework through a review of traditional and current automotive development and two case studies. A major benefit of the application of the framework is the ability to investigate early in the product development process the interactions between requirements and attributes not only of the product, but also of its life cycle processes and their associated organisations. This can lead to better product quality, lower life cycle cost, shorter development time, and manageable complexity. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Often the term lacks precise definition and is used in different ways and for different purposes in the engineering of systems. This paper presents an overview of systems integration at all levels of system engineering and management. The goal of the paper is to present the various views of systems integration including lifecycle, architecture, process, interface, and enterprise, as well as product integration involving software and hardware. We examine systems engineering process, including several process models in an attempt to reveal the activities associated with integration during the engineering of systems. We review the characteristics of interfaces between systems of systems and users that generally give rise to many systems integration concerns. Without very careful effort at developing an appropriate architecture for a system, there will be little hope of integration. We discuss the role of systems management and knowledge integration in architecting for systems integration.

In order that contract information could be understood and processed by machine automatically, more semantic descriptions are needed. Ontology has become a promising technology to express semantics. At present, Web ontology languages have been standardized. However, building domain ontology based on OWL (Ontology Web Language) just begins and has a long way to go. In building domain ontology, people should explore the rationality in expressing domain concepts and relations between the concepts, considering the capabilities of OWL (not the capability of natural languages). In this paper, we put forward a framework of contract ontology after considering capabilities to express semantic relations provided by OWL. Then we use Prot?g?-2000 to build OWL representations of the contract ontology and make some analyses. Our exploration might not standardize contract ontology. We explore with the intention to help people better understand the rationality in expressing concepts and relations between the concepts in contract management in order that OWL contract ontology and other domain ontology are improved and standardized as soon as possible.","2006","2025-03-26 12:56:53","2025-03-26 12:56:53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/edoc.2006.37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this context, performance modeling refers to the measuring of important business aspects in a coordinated manner and the use of these measurements for improved decision making. Goal modeling techniques have shown to be beneficial when expressing and analyzing performance models. Since most regulations are still written in natural language, support for the transformation of regulatory text into performance models is needed. This allows regulators and regulated parties to keep working with familiar natural language regulations and to use goal models indirectly while avoiding a potentially significant learning curve for goal-modeling techniques. In this paper, we present such a tool-supported transformation to goal models expressed with the User Requirements Notation that enables reasoning about outcome-based regulations via widely available evaluation mechanism for goal models. The transformation is implemented in the jUCM-Nav goal modeling tool and illustrated with an example from the banking domain.","2013","2025-03-26 12:56:53","2025-03-26 12:56:53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/relaw.2013.6671344","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the present paper we prove the hardness of the business process regulatory compliance problem by taking into account a sub-problem of the general problem. This limited problem allows to verify only the compliance of structured processes with respect to a regulatory framework composed of a set of conditional obligations including a deadline. Experimental evidence from existing studies shows that compliance is a difficult task. In this paper, despite considering a sub-problem of the general problem, we provide some theoretical evidence of the difficulty of the task. In particular we show that the source of the complexity lies in the core language of verifying conditional obligations with a deadline. We prove that for this simplified case verifying partial compliance belongs to the class of  NP -complete problems, and verifying full compliance belongs to the class of co NP -complete problems. Thus by proving the difficulty of a simplified compliance problem we prove that the general problem of verifying business process regulatory compliance is hard.","2015","2025-03-26 12:56:53","2025-03-26 12:56:53","","","","","","","IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/tsc.2014.2341236","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our system works by first performing a standard HYPO-style CBR analysis and then using the texts associated with certain important classes of cases found in this analysis to “seed” a modified version of INQUERY's relevance feedback mechanism in order to generate a query composed of individual terms or pairs of terms.

Unintended use or even abuse of the law may be the result. Governments therefore should improve their legal quality. The complexity of legislation however makes this task a hard one. The Dutch Tax and Customs Administration (DTCA in Dutch: Belastingdienst) has developed a method and supporting tools that support a systematic translation of (new) legislation into the DTCA's processes. This POWER-method and tools help to improve the quality of (new) legislation and codify the knowledge used in the translation processes in which legislation and regulations are transformed into procedures, computer programs and other designs. Thereby the time-to-market of the implementation of legislation will be reduced. In this article we explain some knowledge representation techniques that we use to improve legal quality. We will also show its application and give real-life examples of anomalies detected. In contrast to other knowledge modelling approaches the POWER-approach is focused on modelling legal sources rather than expert knowledge. Expert knowledge however is still needed to find the correct interpretations but also for efficiency reasons. Starting with representing the (legal) experts' knowledge (using scenarios) helps us to find the adequate scope (the legal sources to be analysed). Confronting the expert with differences between the model build out of the experts' knowledge and the ones we make out of the other knowledge sources (specifically the law) causes the legal experts to see things in a different light and has often led to changes in the law.","2003","2025-03-26 12:56:53","2025-03-26 12:56:53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1145/1047788.1047844","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ashley","Teaching a process model of legal argument with hypotheticals","Artificial Intelligence and Law","","","10.1007/s10506-009-9083-y","","The research described here explores the idea of using Supreme Court oral arguments as pedagogical examples in first year classes to help students learn the role of hypothetical reasoning in law. The article presents examples of patterns of reasoning with hypotheticals in appellate legal argument and in the legal classroom and a process model of hypothetical reasoning that relates them to work in cognitive science and Artificial Intelligence. The process model describes the relationships between an advocate's proposed test for deciding a case or issue, the facts of the hypothetical and of the case to be decided, and the often conflicting legal principles and policies underlying the issue. The process model of hypothetical reasoning has been partially implemented in a computerized teaching environment, LARGO (""Legal ARgument Graph Observer"") that helps students identify, analyze, and reflect on episodes of hypothetical reasoning in oral argument transcripts. Using LARGO, students reconstruct examples of hypothetical reasoning in the oral arguments by representing them in simple diagrams that focus students on the proposed test, the hypothetical challenge to the test, and the responses to the challenge. The program analyzes the diagrams and provides feedback to help students complete the diagrams and reflect on the significance of the hypothetical reasoning in the argument. The article reports the results of experiments evaluating instruction of first year law students at the University of Pittsburgh using the LARGO program as applied to Supreme Court personal jurisdiction cases. The learning results so far have been mixed. Instruction with LARGO has been shown to help law student volunteers with lower LSAT scores learn skills and knowledge regarding hypothetical reasoning better than a text-based approach, but not when the students were required to participate. On the other hand, the diagrams students produce with LARGO have been shown to have some diagnostic value, distinguishing among law students on the basis of LSAT scores, posttest performance, and years in law school. This lends support to the underlying model of hypothetical argument and suggests using LARGO as a pedagogically diagnostic tool.","2009","2025-03-26 12:56:53","2025-03-26 12:56:53","","","","","","","Artificial Intelligence and Law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10506-009-9083-y","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we describe how SME-authored process models can be provided with an operational semantics and grounded in a knowledge representation language like F-logic to support process-related reasoning. The main results of this work include a formalism for process representation and a mechanism for automatically translating process diagrams into executable code following such formalism.

Hayashi case is formalised in Prakken's (Argument Comput 1:93---124; 2010) abstract framework for argument-based inference with structured arguments. In this framework, arguments are inference trees formed by applying two kinds of inference rules, strict and defeasible rules. Arguments can be attacked in three ways: attacking a premise, attacking a conclusion and attacking an inference. To resolve such conflicts, preferences may be used, which leads to three corresponding kinds of defeat, after which Dung's (Artif Intell 77:321---357; 1995) abstract acceptability semantics can be used to evaluate the arguments. In the present paper the abstract framework is instantiated with strict inference rules corresponding to first-order logic and with defeasible inference rules for defeasible modus ponens and various argument schemes. The main techniques used in the formal reconstruction of the case are rule-exception structures and arguments about rule validity. Arguments about socio-legal values and the use of precedent cases are reduced to arguments about rule validity. The tree structure of arguments, with explicit subargument relations between arguments, is used to capture the dependency relations between the elements of the court's decision.","2012","2025-03-26 12:56:53","2025-03-26 12:56:53","","","","","","","Artificial Intelligence and Law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10506-012-9117-8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Briand","An extended systematic literature review on provision of evidence for safety certification","Information & Software Technology","","","10.1016/j.infsof.2014.03.001","","Abstract   Context  Critical systems in domains such as aviation, railway, and automotive are often subject to a formal process of safety certification. The goal of this process is to ensure that these systems will operate safely without posing undue risks to the user, the public, or the environment. Safety is typically ensured via complying with safety standards. Demonstrating compliance to these standards involves providing evidence to show that the safety criteria of the standards are met.    Objective  In order to cope with the complexity of large critical systems and subsequently the plethora of evidence information required for achieving compliance, safety professionals need in-depth knowledge to assist them in classifying different types of evidence, and in structuring and assessing the evidence. This paper is a step towards developing such a body of knowledge that is derived from a large-scale empirically rigorous literature review.    Method  We use a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) as the basis for our work. The SLR builds on 218 peer-reviewed studies, selected through a multi-stage process, from 4963 studies published between 1990 and 2012.    Results  We develop a taxonomy that classifies the information and artefacts considered as evidence for safety. We review the existing techniques for safety evidence structuring and assessment, and further study the relevant challenges that have been the target of investigation in the academic literature. We analyse commonalities in the results among different application domains and discuss implications of the results for both research and practice.    Conclusion  The paper is, to our knowledge, the largest existing study on the topic of safety evidence. The results are particularly relevant to practitioners seeking a better grasp on evidence requirements as well as to researchers in the area of system safety. As a major finding of the review, the results strongly suggest the need for more practitioner-oriented and industry-driven empirical studies in the area of safety certification.","2014","2025-03-26 12:56:53","2025-03-26 12:56:53","","","","","","","Information & Software Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infsof.2014.03.001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent work in forensic statistics has shown how Bayesian Networks (BNs) can be employed for this purpose. However, the specification of BNs requires conditional probability tables describing the uncertain processes under evaluation. When these processes are poorly understood, it is necessary to rely on subjective probabilities provided by experts. Accurate probabilities of this type are normally hard to acquire from experts. Recent work in qualitative reasoning has developed methods to perform probabilistic reasoning using coarser representations. However, the latter types of approaches are too imprecise to compare the likelihood of alternative hypotheses. This paper examines this shortcoming of the qualitative approaches when applied to the aforementioned problem, and identifies and integrates techniques to refine them.","2007","2025-03-26 12:56:53","2025-03-26 12:56:53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1145/1276318.1276322","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are:   A computer-assisted instruction (CAI) course for teaching income tax, programmed using conventional CAI techniques;    A “document modeling” computer program for generating the documentation for a tax-based transaction and advising the lawyer-user as to what decisions should be made and what the tax effects will be, programmed in a conventional language;    A prototype expert system for determining the income tax effects of transactions and tax-defined relationships, based on a PROLOG representation of the rules of the Income Tax Act;    An intelligent CAI (ICAI) system for generating infinite numbers of randomized quiz questions for students, computing the answers, and matching wrong answers to particular student errors, based on a PROLOG representation of the rules of the Income Tax Act; and    A Hypercard stack for providing information about income tax, enabling both education and practical research to follow the user's needs path.     The author shows that non-AI approaches are a way to produce packages quickly and efficiently. Their primary disadvantage is the massive rewriting required when the tax law changes. AI approaches based on PROLOG, on the other hand, are harder to develop to a practical level but will be easier to audit and maintain. The relationship between expert systems and CAI is discussed.","1989","2025-03-26 12:56:53","2025-03-26 12:56:53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1145/74014.74025","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rules that can come into conflict should be regarded as policies, which are inputs to deliberative processes. Dialectical protocols are appropriate for such deliberations when resources are bounded and search is serial. AI, it is claimed here, is now perfectly positioned to correct many misconceptions about reasoning that have resulted from mathematical logic's enormous success in this century: among them, (1) that all reasons are demonstrative, (2) that rational belief is constrained, not constructed, and (3) that process and disputation are not essential to reasoning. AI mainly provides new impetus to formalize the alternative (but older) conception of reasoning, and AI provides mechanisms with which to create compelling formalism that describes the control of processes. The technical contributions here are: the partial justification of dialectic based on controlling search; the observation that nonmonotonic reasoning can be subsumed under certain kinds of dialectics; the portrayal of inference in knowledge bases as policy reasoning; the review of logics of dialogue and proposed extensions; and the preformal and initial formal discussion of aspects and variations of dialectical systems with nondemonstrative reasons.","1998","2025-03-26 12:56:54","2025-03-26 12:56:54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1111/0824-7935.00055","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, the morally binding personal interpretation of the law supervenes on two things together: on the individual?s knowledge of legal institutions and on moral obligation. The first supervenes in its turn on mutual beliefs; the second supervenes on motivations and dispositions of the individual, provided that she is morally sensitive and rational.

Lack of a coordinated pool of legal experts or adequate computational resources are but two reasons responsible for this deficiency. We have undertaken a study to uncover fundamental components of judicial opinions found in American case law. The study was aided by a team of twelve expert attorney-editors with a combined total of 135 years of legal editing experience. The scientific hypothesis underlying the experiment was that after years of working closely with thousands of judicial opinions, expert attorneys would develop a refined and internalized schema of the content and structure of legal cases. In this study participants were permitted to describe both concept-related and format-related components. The resultant components, representing a combination of these two broad categories, are reported on in this paper.

Due to this complexity, traditional engineering management approaches for infrastructure systems are no longer effective in meeting the needs of the stakeholders, including the public at large. This paper proposes that the new direction for infrastructure management should be driven by the body of knowledge associated with development of systems and the management of existing systems (i.e., Systems Engineering/Asset Management). It begins by examining the issues that are important when developing any new engineering management system. It introduces the concept of systems thinking and suggests how a holistic vision can provide an insight into the significant relationships that need to be considered when developing management approaches for infrastructure. It discusses evolving engineering management approaches and how they relate to the changing environment. The paper concludes by suggesting that the adoption of a holistic approach to infrastructure management is the key to managing the increasingly complex interrelationships and will overcome many of the deficiencies in the traditional approaches. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Requirements engineers need to examine this often incomplete and inconsistent brief expression of needs. Based on the available knowledge and expertise, assumptions are made and conclusions are deduced to transform this ‘rough sketch’ into more complete, consistent, and hence correct requirements. This paper addresses the question of how to characterize these properties in an evolutionary framework, and what relationships link these properties to a customer's view of correctness. Moreover, we describe in rigorous terms the different kinds of validation checks that must be performed on different parts of a requirements specification in order to ensure that errors (i.e. cases of inconsistency and incompleteness) are detected and marked as such, leading to better quality requirements.","2004","2025-03-26 12:56:54","2025-03-26 12:56:54","","","","","","","Information & Software Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.infsof.2004.03.003","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The focus is on the process of proof, in which the facts of the case are determined, rather than on related legal issues, such as the admissibility of evidence. In the literature, two approaches to reasoning with evidence can be distinguished, one argument-based and one story-based. In an argument-based approach to reasoning with evidence, the reasons for and against the occurrence of an event, e.g., based on witness testimony, are central. In a story-based approach, evidence is evaluated and interpreted from the perspective of the factual stories as they may have occurred in a case, e.g., as they are defended by the prosecution. In this paper, we argue that both arguments and narratives are relevant and useful in the reasoning with and interpretation of evidence. Therefore, a hybrid-approach is proposed and formally developed, doing justice to both the argument-based and the narrative-based perspective. By the formalization of the theory and the associated graphical representations, our proposal is the basis for the design of software developed as a tool to make sense of the evidence in complex cases.","2010","2025-03-26 12:56:54","2025-03-26 12:56:54","","","","","","","Artificial Intelligence and Law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10506-010-9092-x","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It starts with the observation that logic, although very well applicable to legal reasoning when there is uncertainty, vagueness and disagreement, is too abstract to give a fully satisfactory classification of legal argument types. It therefore needs to be supplemented with an argument-scheme approach, which classifies arguments not according to their logical form but according to their content, in particular, according to the roles that the various elements of an argument can play. This approach is then applied to legal reasoning, to identify some of the main legal argument schemes. It is also argued that much AI & Law research in fact employs the argument-scheme approach, although it usually is not presented as such. Finally, it is argued that the argument-scheme approach and the way it has been employed in AI & Law respects some of the main lessons to be learnt from Toulmin’s The Uses of Argument.","2005","2025-03-26 12:56:54","2025-03-26 12:56:54","","","","","","","Argumentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10503-005-4418-7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Software security has come a long way in the last few years, but we've really only just begun. I will present a detailed approach to getting past theory and putting software security into practice. The three pillars of software security are applied risk management, software security best practices (which I call touchpoints), and knowledge. By describing a manageably small set of touchpoints based around the software artifacts that you already produce, I avoid religious warfare over process and get on with the business of software security. That means you can adopt the touchpoints without radically changing the way you work. The touchpoints I will describe include: code review using static analysis tools; architectural risk analysis; penetration testing; security testing; abuse case development; and security requirements.

We introduce the concept of a refinement process. In the refinement process each compliance template is refined in a layered way to get an executable business process. The refinement steps are executed on refinement layers by different stakeholders. Compliance constraints are used to restrict the way a compliance template can be refined.

"WZ3GSZC5","journalArticle","2011","Bashar Nuseibeh; Bashar Nuseibeh","Editorial: State of the Journal","IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","","","10.1109/tse.2011.17","","HAPPY New Year. It has been exactly one year since I started as Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE), so in this editorial I would like to refl ect on to refl ect on this last year and to share with you some facts and fi gures and my plans for the next year. In my fi rst editorial last January, I suggested three medium term goals for the journals that I reiterate below and which I believe still hold: 1. To reemphasize the broad scope of the journal, encouraging the publication of multidisciplinary research as well as specialization in software engineering. 2. To engage with the software engineering community at large, including other journals, about the software engineering discipline, using not only the journal itself as a forum but through other professional outlets such as conferences and the Web. 3. To support a debate on the nature of scholarly discourse in software engineering, such as the kind and length of papers published in the journal, or the different forms of peer review and discussion around what is published. My fi rst goal above is rather subtle. The scope of the journal is already quite precisely defi ned and has not changed for some time. However, I still believe that as software—and software engineering—continues to permeate society and the development of systems of all kinds, software engineering research also has opportunities to grow. To grow in terms of its interaction with other disciplines outside its traditional boundaries, but also to grow it terms of specialization within, say, problem domain boundaries. To this end, I have encouraged the TSE editorial board to help solicit a broader range of submissions, but also to handle submissions outside TSE’s traditional boundaries with tolerance, even enthusiasm. This sometimes means making an additional effort to guide authors to formulate or reformulate submissions to make the work more accessible to a software engineering audience. The impact of this approach will take some time to have a visible effect, as most of the papers submitted to TSE in 2010 have yet to be published. With respect to my second goal above, community engagement is an ongoing effort. In 2010 I met with the editorsin-chief of many of the software engineering research journals, and we discussed ways in which we can help present research that is novel and exciting, that is rigorous and well-presented, and that is relevant and useful to readers of our publications. I have encouraged, but only been partially successful, in engaging TSE readers to contribute to the debate about the discipline of software engineering. I say “partially successful” because there has been almost no discussion on the TSE electronic forum, but I have received many individual e-mails from readers addressing very specifi c issues, such as those that I raise in my regular editorials. It does seem that an open ended invitation to discuss the discipline is too vague to engage most readers, and so I will continue to discuss specifi c topics in each issue of the journal. The third goal above is one that has been receiving attention from other journal and magazine editors as well. I do sense that the value of journal publications in software engineering is back on the rise, and I feel that my appeal to authors to submit different kinds (and lengths) of manuscripts is being addressed. I have said previously that there is nothing sacred about the kind and length of a software engineering research contribution, and in the last year TSE received more short and a few very long manuscripts. In all cases, I have asked associate editors to consider if content justifi es the length, rather than be distracted by any notion of suggested manuscript length. Papers published in 2011 will be partly the result of such an approach. What else have I learned from year 1? Well, personally, I have been saddened to observe that much of my time is spent handling exceptions of the rather unpleasant variety—plagiarism, duplicate or overlapping submissions, and, in a few cases, appeals. I have absolutely no problem at all with appeals. Authors should feel free to question review decisions on their papers—the review process is not infallible—and queries or complaints help test the robustness of the process and the resultant decisions. Similarly, I encourage readers to write and question or discuss published papers’ content. Some readers have chosen to do this anonymously and that’s fi ne, although I would welcome more open technical commentaries, which TSE has the mechanism to publish in hardcopy or in the digital library. What does bother me are the incidents of what can only be termed unethical behavior—such as plagiarism. The penalties for this are severe, and a “prohibited authors” list is updated and circulated among all IEEE editors each month, with each additional named author fully investigated before being “blacklisted” and barred from future submission to the journal. Incidence of self-plagiarism or duplicate submissions are equally troubling, and a real time drain for editors and reviewers. In a future editorial, I will also discuss the undesirable phenomenon of an LPU—a “least publishable unit”—which unfortunately seems be a way for some authors to increase their publication counts by publishing very small incremental contributions over previously published work. Duplicate or heavily overlapping submissions are often detected, due to the limited and specialized community of reviewers and the open and interactive relationships between journal editors.","2011","2025-03-26 12:56:54","2025-03-26 12:56:54","","","","","","","IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/tse.2011.17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Systems development is facing rapidly changing and increasingly global environments in markets, competition, technology, regulatory, and societal systems. Systems to be delivered must be designed not only to meet customer or market needs, but also increasingly to meet requirements and constraints of systems sharing its operational context and throughout their entire lifecycle. The design of a system must provide for a continuous evolution of its architecture either by upgrading a system already in service or releasing a new version or derivative. Based on these key challenges imposed on development systems, this paper will evolve the idea of incorporating changeability into a system architecture. Flexibility, agility, robustness, and adaptability as four key aspects of changeability will be defined and described. Design principles to enable flexibility, agility, robustness, and adaptability within systems are proposed and described. A basic approach outlining and guiding an application of the framework described concludes this paper. Examples from varying industries will illustrate the applicability and implementation of selected principles. Thus this paper spans a view from why, when, and how changeability has to be incorporated into a system's architecture. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

As enterprises increasingly use business process management systems to automate their business processes, technologies to automatically check the compliance of process models against compliance rules are becoming important. In this paper, we present a method to improve the reliability and minimize the risk of failure of business process management systems from a compliance perspective. The proposed method allows separate modeling of both process models and compliance concerns. Business process models expressed in the Business Process Execution Language are transformed into pi-calculus and then into finite state machines. Compliance rules captured in the graphical Business Property Specification Language are translated into linear temporal logic. Thus, process models can be verified against these compliance rules by means of model-checking technology. The benefit of our method is threefold: Through the automated verification of a large set of business process models, our approach increases deployment efficiency and lowers the risk of installing noncompliant processes; it reduces the cost associated with inspecting business process models for compliance; and compliance checking may ensure compliance of new process models before their execution and thereby increase the reliability of business operations in general.","2007","2025-03-26 12:56:54","2025-03-26 12:56:54","","","","","","","Ibm Systems Journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1147/sj.462.0335","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A survey of current practices indicates we must offer better means for structuring, managing, and developing their use in diverse contexts. The European Esprit project Crews (Cooperative Requirements Engineering with Scenarios) are seeking a deeper understanding of scenario diversity, necessary to improve methodological and tool support for scenario based requirements engineering. They follow a two pronged strategy to gain this understanding. First, following the ""3 dimensions"" requirements engineering framework developed in the precursor Nature project (K. Pohl, 1994), they developed a scenario classification framework based on a comprehensive survey of scenario literature in requirements engineering, human computer interaction, and other fields. They used the framework to classify 11 prominent scenario based approaches. Secondly, to complement this research framework, they investigated scenario applications in industrial projects through site visits with scenario user projects. The article focuses on these site visits. It was found that while many companies express interest in Jacobson's use case approach, actual scenario usage often falls outside what is described in textbooks and standard methodologies. Users therefore face significant scenario management problems not yet addressed adequately in theory or practice, and are demanding solutions to these problems.","1998","2025-03-26 12:56:55","2025-03-26 12:56:55","","","","","","","IEEE Software","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/52.663783","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The prisoner's dilemma can be taken to represent contractual situations, the game of Chicken represents a competitive situation on the one hand and the provision for a common good on the other. Unlike the rules usually used in game theory, each player knows the other's strategy. In that way, ever higher levels of reflection are reached reciprocally.

One of the factors that seems to influence an individual's effectiveness in requirements engineering activities is knowledge of the problem being solved, i.e., domain knowledge. While a requirements engineer's having in-depth domain knowledge helps him or her to understand the problem easier, he or she can fall for tacit assumptions of the domain and might overlook issues that are obvious to domain experts. This paper describes a controlled experiment to test the hypothesis that adding to a requirements elicitation team for a computer-based system in a particular domain, requirements analysts that are ignorant of the domain improves the effectiveness of the requirements elicitation team. The results, although not conclusive, show some support for accepting the hypothesis. The results were analyzed also to determine the effect of creativity, industrial experience, and requirements engineering experience. The results suggest other hypotheses to be studied in the future.","2012","2025-03-26 12:56:55","2025-03-26 12:56:55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/re.2012.6345802","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As initially characterized, the fallacy consists in arguing that failure to prove falsity (truth) implies the truth (falsity) of a proposition. First, the fallacy is located within confirmation theory as a confusion between the categories of “lack of confirming evidence” and “presence of disconfirming evidence”. Second, the structure of the fallacy can be seen as an illicit negation shift in Hintikka-style epistemic logic. Third, the fallacy can be studied as an attempt to unfairly shift the burden of proof in a dialectical game. We suggest that research on ad ignorantiam needs a broadening of the scope of philosophical logic to encompass concepts of correct argument in these three contexts. Resume Cet article propose une analyse en trois parties du sophisme informel traditionnel ad ignorantiam. Sous sa forme originale, celui-ci consiste a argumenter que l'absence de preuve de la faussete (verite) implique la verite (faussete) d'une proposition. 1 Dans le cadre de la theorie de la confirmation, le sophisme apparait comme une confusion entre les categories absence de confirmation experimentale et presence d'infirmation experimentale. 2 Dans le cadre d'une logique epistemique style Hintikka, la structure du sophisme peut etre consideree comme un passage illicite a la negation. 3 Dans un jeu dialectique, le sophisme peut etre presente comme une tentative deloyale pour rejeter sur l'autre la charge de la preuve. Nous pensons que cette recherche sur le sophisme ad ignorantiam exige un elargissement du domaine de la logique philosophique de maniere a ce qu'elle puisse assurer une argumentation correcte dans ces trois contextes. Zusammenfassung Es wird eine dreiteilige Analyse des traditionellen Fehlschlusses ad ignorantiam vorgelegt. Wie eingangs gezeigt wird, besteht der Fehlschluss darin, dass vom Misslingen, die Falschheit eines Satzes zu beweisen, auf seine Wahrheit geschlossen wird. Erstens wird der Fehlschluss im Rahmen der Bewahrungstehorie als Folge einer Verwechslung zwischen den beiden Kategorien des Mangels an Bewahrungsinstanzenund des Vorhandenseins von Bewahrungsinstanzendargestellt. Zweitens kann die Struktur des Fehlschlusses als eine unzulassige Negationsverschiebung im Sinne von Hintikkas epistemischer Logik betrachtet werden. Drittens kann der Fehlschluss als Versuch gedeutet werden, die Beweislast in einem dialektischen Spiel in unfairer Weise auf den Gegner abzuschieben. Es wird nahegelegt, dass die Erforschung dieses Problems eine Erweiterung des Bereichs der philosophischen Logik erfordert, so dass diese auch die Begriffe des korrekten Argumentierens in den drei genannten Kontexten enthalt.","1978","2025-03-26 12:56:55","2025-03-26 12:56:55","","","","","","","Dialectica","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1746-8361.1978.tb01304.x","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These are better called stakeholders, as many roles are involved, and few of those are in direct contact with the developed products. A simple and robust conceptual framework for classifying development stakeholders â€” a taxonomy â€” is proposed. The taxonomy is product centric, with concentric â€œcirclesâ€ denoting broad categories of stakeholders. Within these, generic â€œslotsâ€ describe typical classes of stakeholders; these are subdivided into â€œroles,â€ which are expected to vary at least in name with the domain. Examples are given, and a popular template is reanalysed using the framework. The taxonomy has immediate value in identifying and validating stakeholder roles in requirements elicitation, helping to ensure that key viewpoints are not missed, and hence reducing the risk of instability and failure during development.","2005","2025-03-26 12:56:55","2025-03-26 12:56:55","","","","","","","International Journal of Technology and Human Interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.4018/jthi.2005010102","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In e-participation, there is a clear requirement to understand how technology can support informed debate on issues, but there are two main obstacles in achieving this. The first is that the deliberation is often on complex issues, and therefore typically there are many arguments and counter arguments to consider, which, when presented in linear text, can be confusing for the public at large. Second, it is not obvious that many people actually have the necessary critical thinking skills to deliberate on issues. Argumentation systems have been used successfully in the domains of law and education, where they have been developed in response to a need for innovative and effective ways of teaching critical thinking, presenting and defending a point of ...","2009","2025-03-26 12:56:55","2025-03-26 12:56:55","","","","","","","Journal of Information Technology & Politics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1080/19331680802662113","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I show how we can extend the standard framework for modelling argumentation systems to allow different audiences to be represented. I also show how this formalism can explain how some disputes can be resolved while in others the parties can only agree to differ. I illustrate this by consideration of a legal example. Finally, I make some suggestions as to where these values come from, and how they can be used to explain differences across jurisdictions, and changes in views over time.","2003","2025-03-26 12:56:55","2025-03-26 12:56:55","","","","","","","Artificial Intelligence and Law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1023/b:arti.0000045997.45038.8f","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The design and implementation of services such as integrated access to a wide range of resources are described, with a particular focus on the importance of exploiting metadata assigned to disparate legal material. The integration of structured repositories and Web documents is the main purpose of the system: it is constructed on the basis of a federation system with service provider functions, aiming at creating a centralized index of legal resources. The index is based on a uniform metadata view created for structured data by means of the OAI approach and for Web documents by a machine learning approach, which, in this paper, has been assessed as regards document classification.

The process of constructing the system involves interpreting these legal texts and recasting each of them into one or more formal legal rules. The primary sources of law or law-formulations, to use Susskind’s term [Susskind 87, 36-37, 124], must be transformed into law-statements—statements about what the content of the law is—and these in turn must be translated into a formal language as rules of inference which Susskind terms legal productions. These transformations take place outside the context of specific cases, that is without reference to concrete legal problems those rules are designed to solve. The construction of a legal expert system involves two conceptual steps: to identify the legal norms that a statute conveys and to express these norms as formal rules. Several strategies have been proposed for this transformation process. Some consist of a rather straightforward transposition of law texts into formal language at the expense of a substantial loss of meaning of the legal concepts involved; others call for a subtler and more complex legal analysis. In all cases, however, what is at stake is the interpretation of legal documents. The problem of interpreting legal documents is well known to lawyers. In legal usage, the term interpretation is employed when the meaning of a legal text, typically a statutory provision, has to be assessed in a concrete situation. In constructing expert systems, one must interpret legal documents ahead of such concrete applications. This interpretation can only be provisional. The best one can do in constructing the knowledge base is to foreclose as few as possible of the meanings for particular provisions one may ultimately want to consider in concrete situations. Conversely, when using the system in a particular situation, one may want to consider different interpretations and their","1993","2025-03-26 12:56:55","2025-03-26 12:56:55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1145/158976.158988","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Within this context, however, there is some question of how and why systems may evolve differently. The objective of this work is to answer the question: do systems follow a set of identifiable evolutionary patterns? In this paper we use software volatility to describe the lifecycle evolution of a portfolio of 23 software systems. We show by example that a vector of software volatility levels can represent lifecycle behavior of a software system. We further demonstrate that the portfolio ' s 23 software volatility vectors can be grouped into four distinguishable patterns.

To explore the basic question whether UX constructs are measurable, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 10 UX researchers from academia and one UX practitioner from the industry where a set of questions in relation to UX measurement were explored (Study 1). The interviewees expressed scepticism as well as ambivalence towards UX measures and shared anecdotes related to such measures in different contexts. Interestingly, the results suggested that design-oriented UX professionals tended to be sceptical about UX measurement. To examine whether such an attitude prevailed in the HCI community, we conducted a survey –  UX Measurement Attitudes Survey  (UXMAS) – with essentially the same set of 13 questions used in the interviews (Study 2). Specifically, participants were asked to rate a set of five statements to assess their attitude towards UX measurement, to identify (non)measurable experiential qualities with justifications, and to discuss the topic from the theoretical, methodological and practical perspectives. The survey was implemented in a paper-based and an online format. Altogether, 367 responses were received; 170 of them were valid and analysed. The survey provided empirical evidence on this issue as a baseline for progress in UX measurement. Overall, the survey results indicated that the attitude towards UX measurement was more positive than that identified in the interviews, and there were nuanced views on details of UX measurement. Implications for enhancing the acceptance of UX measures and the interplay between UX evaluation and system development are drawn: UX modelling grounded in theories to link experiential qualities with outcomes; the development of UX measurement tools with good measurement properties, and education within the HCI community to disseminate validated models, and measurement tools as well as their successful applications. Mutual recognition of the value of objective measures and subjective accounts of user experience can enhance the maturity of this area.","2014","2025-03-26 12:56:55","2025-03-26 12:56:55","","","","","","","International Journal of Human-computer Studies \/ International Journal of Man-machine Studies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhcs.2013.09.006","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although a great attention has been paid to design semantic similarity/relatedness methods based on taxonomies, there has been little discussion about the design of semantic similarity/relatedness methods based on ontologies. In this paper we introduce a novel graph-based semantic relatedness approach to calculate semantic relatedness considering both hierarchical and non-hierarchical concepts in an ontology. In addition, our approach considers some important properties such as different relation types, concepts' depth and distance that play an essential role in measuring semantic relatedness. Three experimental studies are provided to first illustrate that our approach give a different results than other measures in the literature. Then, we compare our approach against existed methods using a benchmark dataset, and finally, evaluate our approach by using a real ontology and compare the predictions of our semantic relatedness approach against the human-subject judgment. The results in all the experiments show a considerable improvement against traditional taxonomy-based measures.","2011","2025-03-26 12:56:55","2025-03-26 12:56:55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1145/1988688.1988722","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Researchers proposing a new metric have the burden of proof to demonstrate to the research community that the metric is acceptable in its intended use. This burden of proof is provided through the multi-faceted, scientific, and objective process of software metrics validation. Over the last 40 years, however, researchers have debated what constitutes a “valid” metric.   Aim. The debate over what constitutes a valid metric centers on software metrics validation criteria. The objective of this article is to guide researchers in making sound contributions to the field of software engineering metrics by providing a practical summary of the metrics validation criteria found in the academic literature.   Method. We conducted a systematic literature review that began with 2,288 papers and ultimately focused on 20 papers. After extracting 47 unique validation criteria from these 20 papers, we performed a comparative analysis to explore the relationships amongst the criteria.   Results. Our 47 validation criteria represent a diverse view of what constitutes a valid metric. We present an analysis of the criteria's categorization, conflicts, common themes, and philosophical motivations behind the validation criteria.   Conclusions. Although the 47 validation criteria are not conflict-free, the diversity of motivations and philosophies behind the validation criteria indicates that metrics validation is complex. Researchers proposing new metrics should consider the applicability of the validation criteria in terms of our categorization and analysis. Rather than arbitrarily choosing validation criteria for each metric, researchers should choose criteria that can confirm that the metric is appropriate for its intended use. We conclude that metrics validation criteria provide answers to questions that researchers have about the merits and limitations of a metric.","2012","2025-03-26 12:56:55","2025-03-26 12:56:55","","","","","","","ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1145/2377656.2377661","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper we reflect on our experience with developing a knowledge representation language for legal rules and an inference engine for this language in the Estrella project, in order to reconsider the principles which should guide the representation of legislation. One common demand, based largely on software engineering considerations relating to maintenance, verification and validation, is that representations should be isomorphic to their sources. We explore this notion by representing a fragment of German Family Law using our tools. We show that there are several different ways of representing even this small and simple fragment of law in an isomorphic fashion.

In part, this is due to the way the Bayesian approach fits the scientific method employed in forensic practice. The design of Bayesian networks that accurately and comprehensively represent the relationships between investigative hypotheses and evidence remains difficult and sometimes contentious, however. Recent research has shown that argumentation can inform the construction of Bayesian networks. But argumentation is a distinct approach to evidential reasoning with its on representation formalisms. This issue could be alleviated if it were easy to represent Bayesian networks as argumentation diagrams.

The framework includes not only key uncertainty drivers but also the hypothesized or theorized relationships between them. Since risk is more than just uncertainty, consequences of schedule overruns and of schedule uncertainty itself are also discussed.

Using models to make goals explicit helps to avoid system failures due to implementing the wrong requirements or ignoring certain stakeholder needs. These models are unique when compared to other models used in system analysis in that their structure naturally lends itself to an analysis of goal satisfaction. Existing work claims that analysis using goal models can facilitate decision making over functional or design alternatives, using criteria in the model. Many different approaches to the analysis of goal-oriented requirements models have been proposed, including several procedures that analyze the satisfaction or denial of goals. These procedures make different choices in their interpretation of the goal model syntax, the methods to resolve conflicting or partial evidence, and in the way they represent satisfaction. This work uses three available tools implementing seven similar goal satisfaction analysis procedures to analyze three sample goal models. Results are reported and compared. The purpose of this comparison is to understand the ways in which procedural design choices affect analysis results, and how differences in analysis results could lead to different recommendations over alternatives in the model. Our comparison shows that different satisfaction analysis techniques for goal models can produce variable results, depending on the structure of the model. Comparison findings lead us to recommend the use of satisfaction analysis techniques for goal models as only heuristics for decision making. Our results emphasize investigation into the benefits of satisfaction analysis beyond decision making, namely improving model quality, increasing domain knowledge, and facilitating communication.","2013","2025-03-26 12:56:56","2025-03-26 12:56:56","","","","","","","Requirements Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-011-0143-y","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The author then summarises his most recent results outlining a proof that every E-type program reflects an unbounded number of assumptions about the application implemented, supported or modelled by the program. He shows that the presence of such assumptions is inevitable and that some of these become invalid over time as a consequence of changes in the dynamic real world. Some of the finite set of known assumptions reflected in the program is also become invalid. Together the resultant ever extending invalidity causes the software to require continuing change or to become ever more unsatisfactory or even invalid. This phenomenon provides the underlying and unavoidable cause of the universal experience that E-type software must be continually evolved to remain satisfactory and suggests that its further study and the development of methods and tools to reduce its considerable impact, economic and social cost, must form an important part of future software engineering R & D.","2001","2025-03-26 12:56:56","2025-03-26 12:56:56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1145/602461.602473","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper describes a comparative analysis approach and its potential application to assist locating relevant regulations from different sources. Examples from environmental regulations are employed to illustrate the proposed methodology and framework.","2006","2025-03-26 12:56:56","2025-03-26 12:56:56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1145/1146598.1146662","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The latter include a semantic component that describes licenses, i.e. rights of use which are granted to the user. These elements of Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems are called Rights Expression Languages (REL), they gather terms and relations needed to build licenses. Some are based on an ontology of online licenses, not necessarily related to applicable law and various legal systems, and cannot interoperate. As a consequence, there is a need for a more generic way to express licenses. Here, generic means that rightholders should only need to express the license they need once, and semi-automatic tools should then translate this license so it can be browsed by any specific system. Hence it implies the necessity to be able to model concept semantics in order to translate a license expressed in generic terms into more specific terms that are compliant with the specific standards used by distribution systems. This work comes as part of larger studies on legal ontologies, legal systems and RELs.","2007","2025-03-26 12:56:56","2025-03-26 12:56:56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1145/1276318.1276330","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The United States American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 provides up to $34 billion for meaningful use of certified EHR systems. But, will these certified EHR systems provide the infrastructure for secure patient data exchange? As a window into the ability of current and emerging certification criteria to expose security vulnerabilities, we performed exploratory security analysis on a proprietary and an open source EHR. We were able to exploit a range of common code-level and design-level vulnerabilities. These common vulnerabilities would have remained undetected by the 2011 security certification test scripts from the Certification Commission for Health Information Technology, the most widely used certification process for EHR systems. The consequences of these exploits included, but were not limited to: exposing all users' login information, the ability of any user to view or edit health records for any patient, and creating a denial of service for all users. Based upon our results, we suggest that an enhanced set of security test scripts be used as entry criteria to the EHR certification process. Before certification bodies spend the time to certify that an EHR application is functionally complete, they should have confidence that the software system meets a basic level of security competence.","2010","2025-03-26 12:56:56","2025-03-26 12:56:56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1145/1866914.1866916","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In particular, this development requires more effective and efficient evidence collection strategies, which are likely to produce the most conclusive information with limited available resources. Evidence collection is a difficult task, however, because it necessitates consideration of: a wide range of plausible crime scenarios, the evidence that may be produced under these hypothetical scenarios, and the investigative techniques that can recover and interpret the plausible pieces of evidence. A knowledge based system (KBS) can help crime investigators by retrieving and reasoning with such knowledge, provided that the KBS is sufficiently versatile to infer and analyse a wide range of plausible scenarios. This paper presents such a KBS. It employs a novel compositional modelling technique that is integrated into a Bayesian model based diagnostic system. These theoretical developments are illustrated by a realistic example of serious crime investigation.","2011","2025-03-26 12:56:56","2025-03-26 12:56:56","","","","","","","Applied Intelligence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10489-009-0208-5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Organizations need to ensure that the commitments they express in their policy documents reflect their actual business practices. This compliance is significant in the United States where the Federal Trade Commission regulates fair business practices. Therefore, the requirements engineers developing systems for organizations need to understand the policy documents in order to know the information practices with which the software must comply. The requirements engineers also must ensure that the commitments expressed in these policy documents are incorporated into the software requirements. In this paper, we present a summative case study of a commitment analysis approach. The approach was developed during a formative case study of four healthcare organizations’ policy documents. Within this approach, we obtain requirements from policy documents based on our theory of commitments, privileges, and rights. During our summative case study we applied our commitment analysis approach to eight healthcare organizations’ policy documents in order to validate the methodology. We discuss the results of the summative study, in which we found that most of the statements express organizational practices or procedures.

Such dialogues are typically conducted by exchanging arguments for and against certain options. The moves of the dialogue are designed to facilitate such exchanges.

ME is established based on the divide-and-conquer principle in which the problem space is divided between a few neural network experts, supervised by a gating network. In earlier works on ME, different strategies were developed to divide the problem space between the experts. To survey and analyse these methods more clearly, we present a categorisation of the ME literature based on this difference. Various ME implementations were classified into two groups, according to the partitioning strategies used and both how and when the gating network is involved in the partitioning and combining procedures. In the first group, The conventional ME and the extensions of this method stochastically partition the problem space into a number of subspaces using a special employed error function, and experts become specialised in each subspace. In the second group, the problem space is explicitly partitioned by the clustering method before the experts' training process starts, and each expert is then assigned to one of these sub-spaces. Based on the implicit problem space partitioning using a tacit competitive process between the experts, we call the first group the mixture of implicitly localised experts (MILE), and the second group is called mixture of explicitly localised experts (MELE), as it uses pre-specified clusters. The properties of both groups are investigated in comparison with each other. Investigation of MILE versus MELE, discussing the advantages and disadvantages of each group, showed that the two approaches have complementary features. Moreover, the features of the ME method are compared with other popular combining methods, including boosting and negative correlation learning methods. As the investigated methods have complementary strengths and limitations, previous researches that attempted to combine their features in integrated approaches are reviewed and, moreover, some suggestions are proposed for future research directions.","2014","2025-03-26 12:56:56","2025-03-26 12:56:56","","","","","","","Artificial Intelligence Review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10462-012-9338-y","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The example studied is Gerry Spence's closing argument in the case of Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corporation, said to be the most persuasive closing argument ever used in an American trial. It is shown using this example how argument from analogy is based on a similarity premise where similarity between two cases is modeled using the device of a story scheme from the hybrid theory of legal evidential reasoning (Bex in Arguments, stories and criminal evidence: a formal hybrid theory. Springer, Dordrecht 2011).

In particular, goals provide the rationale and drivethe elaboration of the requirements that operationalise them. They also provide the criteria against which the completeness and correctness of the requirements specification is validated. In other words, requirements implement goals in the same way that programs implement design specifications. Despite the significance of goals in RE, research in the field is fragmented. No research has so far taken place in order to define the overall role that goals play in RE. This paper puts forward a unifying view of goal analysis in the context of RE. This allows the identification of similarities and differences between the different conceptions of goal used by different approaches and promotes the understanding of the overall role of goal analysis in RE. Based on this understanding the various approaches can be put together, thus leading to a stronger goal-driven RE framework that takes advantage of the contributions from the many streams of goal-oriented research.","2002","2025-03-26 12:56:56","2025-03-26 12:56:56","","","","","","","Requirements Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/pl00010362","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I derive the optimal fine for the underlying offense, the optimal fine for misrepresenting one's wealth level, and the optimal audit probability. I demonstrate that the optimal fine for misrepresenting wealth equals the fine for the offense divided by the audit probability, and therefore generally exceeds the fine for the offense. The optimal audit probability is positive, increases as the cost of an audit declines, and equals unity if the cost is sufficiently low. If the optimal audit probability is less than unity, there are some individuals who are capable of paying the fine for the offense who misrepresent their wealth levels. I also show that the optimal fine for the offense results in underdeterrence due to the cost of auditing wealth levels.","2006","2025-03-26 12:56:57","2025-03-26 12:56:57","","","","","","","International Review of Law and Economics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.583923","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is important that the written documentation is integrated into such decision systems in order to refer to the texts to explain decisions, to update the systems when the policy evolves or, conversely, to amend the source documents if some of the rules happen to be inconsistent. The problem is that the complexity of information to be searched for is not reachable by an automated processing, but that their volume prohibits a manual one.

While systems vary from organization to organization, regulations apply across organizations. We propose the use of Behavior-Driven-Development (BDD) scenarios as the basis of an automated compliance test suite for standards such as regulation and interoperability. Such test suites could become a shared asset for use by all systems subject to these regulations and standards. Each system, then, need only create their own system-specific test driver code to automate their compliance checks. The goal of this research is to enable organizations to compare their systems to regulation in a repeatable and traceable way through the use of BDD. To evaluate our proposal, we developed an abbreviated HIPAA test suite and applied it to three open-source electronic health record systems. The scenarios covered all security behavior defined by the selected regulation. The system-specific test driver code covered all security behavior defined in the scenarios, and identified where the tested system lacked such behavior.","2013","2025-03-26 12:56:57","2025-03-26 12:56:57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/sehc.2013.6602477","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This difference is, amongst others, reflected in the defeasibility of arguments in which rules play a role. Reason‐based logic is a logic that has special facilities for dealing with rules and with reasons based on rules. In particular it allows arguments in which conclusions are derived by ‘weighing’ the reasons that plead for and against them. In this article we illustrate some characteristics of reasoning with rules, and show how reason‐based logic deals with these characteristics. The article is concluded with some general considerations concerning reason‐based logic and a comparison with some other logics for defeasible reasoning.","1994","2025-03-26 12:56:57","2025-03-26 12:56:57","","","","","","","Information & Communications Technology Law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1080/13600834.1994.9965701","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It extends the argument for why evaluation is essential in formal Artificial Intelligence and Law reports such as those in the journal. As in the case of two earlier works on the topic, it pursues answers to the questions: how good is the system, algorithm or proposal?, how reliable is the approach or technique?, and, ultimately, does the method work? The paper investigates the role of performance evaluation in scientific research reports, underscoring the argument that a performance-based 'ethic' signifies a level of maturity and scientific rigor within a community.

Where a statutory provision does not apply to a case, the principle of e contrario, that if the case is not covered by the rule the negation of the conclusion can be taken as established, has typically been assumed to apply. There are, however, cases where analogy is an appropriate way to bring a case under a statutory rule. In this paper we discuss using analogy in reasoning with states, and where this should be avoided and e contrario followed.

To fill this gap we conducted two qualitative studies of programmers performing change tasks to medium to large sized programs. One study involved newcomers working on assigned change tasks to a medium-sized code base. The other study involved industrial programmers working on their own change tasks on code with which they had experience. The focus of our analysis has been on what information a programmer needs to know about a code base while performing a change task and also on howthey go about discovering that information. Based on this analysis we catalog and categorize 44 different kinds of questions asked by our participants. We also describe important context for how those questions were answered by our participants, including their use of tools.","2006","2025-03-26 12:56:57","2025-03-26 12:56:57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1145/1181775.1181779","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"8KPS6KWC","journalArticle","1997","Pamela Zave; Pamela Zave","Classification of research efforts in requirements engineering","ACM Computing Surveys","","","10.1145/267580.267581","","Requirements engineering is the branch of software engineering concerned with the real-world goals for, functions of, and constraints on software systems. It is also concerned with the relationship of these factors to precise specifications of software behavior, and to their evolution over time and across software families. Of all the areas in which computer scientists do research, requirements engineering is probably the most informal, interdisciplinary, and subjective. Although these qualities are inherent to the topic under investigation, they make scientists and mathematicians uncomfortable. Given these circumstances, a rigorous classification of research efforts in requirements engineering-if comprehensive and intelligible-might have several benefits, including: 1. It would delineate the area and would encourage research coverage of the whole area. 2. It would provide structure that might encourage the discovery and articulation of new principles. 3. It would assist in grouping similar things, such as competing solutions to the same problem. These groupings would be a great help in comparing, extending, and exploiting results. This article proposes and justifies a trial classification scheme. An earlier version was used to organize the papers submitted to this symposium, and the scheme has been refined somewhat in response to inadequacies discovered during the process of selecting the program. It is offered in hopes of stimulating discussion and eventual consensus. The fist issue to be tackled is the heterogeneity of the topics usually considered part of requirements engineering. They include Tasks that must be completed: elicitation, validation, specification. Problems that must be solved: barriers to communication, incompleteness, inconsistency. Solutions to problems: formal languages and analysis algorithms, prototyping, metrics, traceability. Ways of contributing to knowledge: descriptions of practice, case studies, controlled experiments. Types of system:: embedded systems, safety-critical systems, distributed systems. A list with all these topics is intended to be comprehensive, but its heterogeneity undermines all chance of bringing order to the field. There seems to be a need for several orthogonal dimensions of classification. While multiple dimensions will certainly help us cope with the heterogeneity of concerns, there is a danger of making the classification scheme too complex to use. I have compromised by settling on two dimensions, which are presented separately in the next two sections.","1997","2025-03-26 12:56:57","2025-03-26 12:56:57","","","","","","","ACM Computing Surveys","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1145/267580.267581","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The author begins by presenting a new analysis of the concept of legitimate authority and then gives a detailed explanation of the legal positivist's approach to law. Within this framework the author examines several areas where legal analysis is often thought to be impregnated with moral values, namely the social functions of law, the ideals of the rule of law, and the role of the courts. The last part of the book is devoted to some key substantive problems. The author argues that there is no obligation to obey the law. He provides a new analysis of respect for law, emphasizing its moral importance. The author maintains there is no right to civil disobedience in a liberal state (though actos of civil disobedience may occasionally be justified even in such a state) and he argues for a right of conscientious objection in certain areas.","1979","2025-03-26 12:56:57","2025-03-26 12:56:57","","","","","","","The Philosophical Review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198253457.001.0001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, organizations need to have a clear understanding of all the relevant regulations and verify that their business processes are designed and performed in a desired way. However, regulations can be fairly complex in terms of the conditions, targets, and scopes they refer to. Moreover, when considering a set of regulations, the possibility of interrelationships between them brings added complexity to compliance checking. Thus, ensuring regulatory compliance is not only labor and time consuming but also complex. In this paper, we propose a consistency and compliance checker framework (CCCF) that considers sets of interrelated regulations and aims at providing automated supports for organizations to analyze and verify their regulatory compliance. More specifically, CCCF takes legal regulations and business processes as inputs and provides the results of whether the regulations are consistent, whether the business processes are compliant with the regulations, and which business operations need to be adjusted in case of non-compliance. To validate our approach, we use a case study of customs declaration in international trade .","2015","2025-03-26 12:56:57","2025-03-26 12:56:57","","","","","","","Ai & Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00146-014-0536-9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The paper considers a number of characteristics which make the development of legal expert systems different in character from the development of similar systems in engineering, medicine and the natural sciences. These differences, together with some practical constraints, has been responsible for the particular form which the software tools have taken.We argue there are a number of systems which have been built or are being built by people whose primary interest and training is in computer science and who fundamentally misunderstand the nature of law and legal reasoning, primarily widespread misconception that law is a simple system of rules and that legal inference consists of a simple deductive application of these rules. We challenge the view that there is need to construct ""deep conceptual"" models before effective legal expert systems may be built, concluding that it is an empirical problem which may only be resolved by building systems and evaluating their performance. The design criteria for the software and applications developed by the DataLex Project are then set out, and the shell and a number of resulting applications described. The shell includes both a decision network module (LES:DN) and a module for precedent analysis by nearest neighbour discriminant analysis (PAANDA). A full text retrieval system (AIRS) is intended to be integrated into the shell, and the reasons why this is necessary are explained.

In this context, performance modeling refers to the measuring of important business aspects in a coordinated manner and the use of these measurements for improved decision making. Considering that in many cases regulatory texts already exist, it is necessary to build a performance model based on existing regulations that may be still prescriptive rather than outcome-based. The process of turning the underlying textual legislation into a formal performance model that can be assessed by Business Intelligence (BI) tools is complicated due to organizational, cultural, and technological reasons.

These concepts are used to express normative relations between a bearer and a counterpart. They play a predominant role in Hohfeld’s analysis of rights. On our analysis, a directed obligation is defined as a conj unction of a statement expressing that a bearer ought to do a certain act and a statement expressing that it ought to be the case for the counterpart that the bearer does this act. A similar definition is offered of directed prohibition and permission. The proposed analysis is discussed in view of two competing theories of rights: the benefit theory and the claimant theory. The present proposal is found to be supported by the benefit theory. 1 The problem of how to represent directed obligations This paper contributes to the formal analysis of the concept of rights in the tradition from Hohfeld, Kanger and Lindahl. In a number of papers Allen and Saxon have defended the value of a formal representation of rights when making programs to aid the process of drafting or interpreting law (cf. [AS86], [AS93a], [AS93b]). (Concerning the relevance to automated tools for legal drafting, see also [H G93].) This supports the relevance of our paper to AI and Law. Furthermore, Jones and Sergot argues that certain complex systems are best analysed from a ‘normative perspective’, and suggests Lindahl’s analysis as a useful tool (cf. [JS93] ).

The legal domain is an instance of a domain in which knowledge is incomplete, uncertain, and inconsistent. Argumentation is well suited for reasoning in such weak theory domains. We model argument both as information structure, i.e., argument units connecting claims with supporting data, and as dialectical process, i.e., an alternating series of moves by opposing sides. Our model includes burden of proof as a key element, indicating what level of support must be achieved by one side to win the argument. Burden of proof acts as move filter, turntaking mechanism, and termination criterion, eventually determining the winner of an argument. Our model has been implemented in a computer program. We demonstrate the model by considering program output for two examples previously discussed in the artificial intelligence and legal reasoning literature.","1996","2025-03-26 12:56:57","2025-03-26 12:56:57","","","","","","","Artificial Intelligence and Law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/bf00118492","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The experiment is designed based on the requirements management process at a large market-driven software development company that develops generic solutions to satisfy many different customers. New requirements and requests for information are continuously issued, which must be analyzed and responded to. The new requirements should first be consolidated with the old to avoid reanalysis of previously elicited requirements and to complement existing requirements with new information. In the presented experiment, a new open-source tool is evaluated in a laboratory setting. The tool uses linguistic engineering techniques to calculate similarities between requirements and presents a ranked list of suggested similar requirements, between which links may be assigned. It is hypothesized that the proposed technique for finding and linking similar requirements makes the consolidation more efficient. The results show that subjects that are given the support provided by the tool are significantly more efficient and more correct in consolidating two requirements sets, than are subjects that do not get the support. The results suggest that the proposed techniques may give valuable support and save time in an industrial requirements consolidation process.","2006","2025-03-26 12:56:58","2025-03-26 12:56:58","","","","","","","Empirical Software Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10664-006-6405-5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The sudden eruption of activity in the area of opinion mining and sentiment analysis, which deals with the computational treatment of opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity in text, has thus occurred at least in part as a direct response to the surge of interest in new systems that deal directly with opinions as a first-class object. This survey covers techniques and approaches that promise to directly enable opinion-oriented information-seeking systems. Our focus is on methods that seek to address the new challenges raised by sentiment-aware applications, as compared to those that are already present in more traditional fact-based analysis.

An abstract argumentation system is a collection of “defeasible proofs”, called arguments, that is partially ordered by a relation expressing the difference in conclusive force. The prefix “abstract” indicates that the theory is concerned neither with a specification of the underlying language, nor with the development of a subtheory that explains the partial order. An unstructured language, without logical connectives such as negation, makes arguments not (pairwise) inconsistent, but (groupwise) incompatible. Incompatibility and difference in conclusive force cause defeat among arguments. The aim of the theory is to find out which arguments eventually emerge undefeated. These arguments are considered to be in force. Several results are established. The main result is that arguments that are in force are precisely those that are in the limit of a so-called complete argumentation sequence.","1997","2025-03-26 12:56:58","2025-03-26 12:56:58","","","","","","","Artificial Intelligence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1016/s0004-3702(96)00041-0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The strategies include hierarchical modeling, logical clustering of artifacts, and semi-automated pruning of the probabilistic network.

Existing research largely focuses on checking consistency of individual models and of relationships between pairs of models. However, such strategy does not guarantee global consistency. In this paper, we propose a consistency checking approach that addresses this problem for homogeneous models. Given a set of models and a set of relationships between them, our approach works by first constructing a merged model and then verifying this model against the consistency constraints of interest. By keeping proper traceability information, consistency diagnostics obtained over the merge are projected back to the original models and their relationships. The paper also presents a set of reusable expressions for defining consistency constraints in conceptual modelling.

Requirements engineers have begun to model privacy requirements based on taxonomic classifications of privacy. Independently, legal research has modeled privacy harms in a taxonomic fashion. In this paper, we compare a requirements engineering taxonomy of privacy protections and vulnerabilities to a legal taxonomy of privacy harms. We seek to determine the extent to which the concepts and terminology are consistent between the two taxonomies. A consistent, standard vocabulary for privacy concepts for both requirements engineers and lawyers will improve the common understanding of privacy concepts, legal traceability and compliance auditing. We conclude that the taxonomies we analyzed are reasonably compatible. We believe this compatibility indicates that a taxonomic understanding of privacy is a promising area of research for requirements engineers.","2008","2025-03-26 12:56:58","2025-03-26 12:56:58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/relaw.2008.1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From customer's perspective, the activity of continuous requirements reprioritization forms the very core of today's agile approaches. However, the freedom for clients to do so does not come for free. This paper presents results of a literature review on agile requirements prioritization methods, derives a conceptual model for understanding the inter-iteration prioritization process in terms of inputs and outcomes, and identifies issues and solutions pertinent to agile prioritization.

Computer support for this transition between requirements and design is important for a successful application of UML's highly iterative, distributed software development process. There are three main issues which must be addressed when generating statecharts from sequence diagrams. Firstly, conflicts arising from the merging of independently developed sequence diagrams must be detected and resolved. Secondly, different sequence diagrams often contain identical or similar behaviors. For a true interleaving of the sequence diagrams, these behaviors must be recognized and merged. Finally, generated statecharts usually are only an approximation of the system and thus must be hand-modified and refined by designers. As such, the generated artifact should be highly structured and readable. In terms of statecharts, this corresponds to the introduction of hierarchy. Our algorithm successfully tackles all three of these aspects and will be illustrated in this paper with a well-known ATM example.","2000","2025-03-26 12:56:58","2025-03-26 12:56:58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1145/337180.337217","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A key concern for professionals in any industry is ensuring regulatory compliance. Regulations are often complex and require in depth technical knowledge of the domain in which they operate. The level of technical detail and complexity in regulations is a barrier to their automation due to extensive software development time and costs that are involved. In this paper we present a rule-based semantic approach formulated as a methodology to overcome these issues by allowing domain experts to specify their own regulatory compliance systems without the need for extensive software development. Our methodology is based on the key idea that three semantic contexts are needed to fully understand the regulations being automated: the semantics of the target domain, the specific semantics of regulations being considered, and the semantics of the data format that is to be checked for compliance. This approach allows domain experts to create and maintain their own regulatory compliance systems, within a semantic domain that is familiar to them. At the same time, our approach allows for the often diverse nature of semantics within a particular domain by decoupling the specific semantics of regulations from the semantics of the domain itself. This paper demonstrates how our methodology has been validated using a series of regulations automated by professionals within the construction domain. The regulations that have been developed are then in turn validated on real building data stored in an industry specific format (the IFCs). The adoption of this methodology has greatly advanced the process of automating these complex sets of construction regulations, allowing the full automation of the regulation scheme within 18months. We believe that these positive results show that, by adopting our methodology, the barriers to the building of regulatory compliance systems will be greatly lowered and the adoption of three semantic domains proposed by our methodology provides tangible benefits.","2015","2025-03-26 12:56:58","2025-03-26 12:56:58","","","","","","","Expert Systems With Applications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2015.02.029","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We performed a systematic review of studies that compared predictions from cross-company models with predictions from within-company models based on analysis of project data. Ten papers compared cross-company and within-company estimation models; however, only seven presented independent results. Of those seven, three found that cross-company models were not significantly different from within-company models, and four found that cross-company models were significantly worse than within-company models. Experimental procedures used by the studies differed making it impossible to undertake formal meta-analysis of the results. The main trend distinguishing study results was that studies with small within-company data sets (i.e., $20 projects) that used leave-one-out cross validation all found that the within-company model was significantly different (better) from the cross-company model. The results of this review are inconclusive. It is clear that some organizations would be ill-served by cross-company models whereas others would benefit. Further studies are needed, but they must be independent (i.e., based on different data bases or at least different single company data sets) and should address specific hypotheses concerning the conditions that would favor cross-company or within-company models. In addition, experimenters need to standardize their experimental procedures to enable formal meta-analysis, and recommendations are made in Section 3.","2007","2025-03-26 12:56:58","2025-03-26 12:56:58","","","","","","","IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/tse.2007.1001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing approaches require the knowledge engineer to explicitly state all relevant priorities which are then handled in an extra-logical manner, or they are restricted to priorities based on specificity, neglecting other relevant criteria. We present an approach where priority information can be represented within the logical language. Our approach is based on PDL, a prioritized extension of Reiter's Default Logic recently proposed by the same author. In PDL the generation of extensions is controlled by an ordering of the defaults. This property is used here in the following way: we first build Reiter extensions of a given default theory. These extensions contain explicit information about the priorities of defaults. We then eliminate every extension E that cannot be reconstructed as a PDL extension based on a default ordering that is compatible with the priority information in E. An example from legal reasoning illustrates the power of our approach.","1994","2025-03-26 12:56:58","2025-03-26 12:56:58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Reasoning%20about%20priorities%20in%20default%20logic","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Simulating how the social and technical networks co-evolve over time allows us to explore possible system futures. This knowledge can help today’s decision makers to steer the system away from undesirable evolutionary pathways. Creating models that capture the complexity of socio-technical systems co-evolution requires multiple formalisms to be encoded in a modeling framework that itself evolves. This thesis presents a method for creating Agent Based Models that suitably represent complex evolving systems. The method involves a co-evolution between the technical aspects of model development, the social process involving the stakeholders, the collection of relevant domain knowledge and the encoding of facts.

In this paper, we show how such power indices can be applied to understanding the relative importance of agents when we attempt to devise a coordination mechanism using the paradigm of social laws, or normative systems. Understanding how pivotal an agent is with respect to the success of a particular social law is of benefit when designing such social laws: we might typically aim to ensure that power is distributed evenly amongst the agents in a system, to avoid bottlenecks or single points of failure. After formally defining the framework and illustrating the role of power indices in it, we investigate the complexity of computing these indices, showing that the characteristic complexity result is #P-completeness.

Jaap van den Herik","An Integrated View on Rules and Principles","Artificial Intelligence and Law","","","10.1023/a:1008247812801","","In the law, it is generally acknowledged that there are intuitive differences between reasoning with rules and reasoning with principles. For instance, a rule seems to lead directly to its conclusion if its condition is satisfied, while a principle seems to lead merely to a reason for its conclusion. However, the implications of these intuitive differences for the logical status of rules and principles remain controversial. A radical opinion has been put forward by Dworkin (1978). The intuitive differences led him to argue for a strict logical distinction between rules and principles. Ever since, there has been a controversy whether the intuitive differences between rules and principles require a strict logical distinction between the two. For instance, Soeteman (1991) disagrees with Dworkin's opinion, and argues that rules and principles cannot be strictly distinguished, and do not have a different logical structure. In this paper, we claim that the differences between rules and principles are merely a matter of degree. We give an integrated view on rules and principles in which rules and principles have the same logical structure, but different behavior in reasoning. In this view, both rules and principles are considered to consist of a condition and a conclusion. The observed differences between rules and principles are, in our view, the result of different types of relations that they have with other rules and principles. In the integrated view, typical rules and typical principles are the extremes of a spectrum. We support our claim by giving an explicit formalization of our integrated view using the recently developed formal tools provided by Reason-Based Logic. As an application of our view on rules and principles, we give three ways of reconstructing reasoning by analogy.","1998","2025-03-26 12:56:59","2025-03-26 12:56:59","","","","","","","Artificial Intelligence and Law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1023/a:1008247812801","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, little is known about how successful software systems have evolved, and consequently little has been learned from previous experience. We demonstrate a heuristic to reconstruct evolution processes of existing software systems by exploiting techniques to detect duplication in large amounts of data.

We demonstrate how a sufficiently rich meta level logic can formally capture intuitive aspects of managing changes to requirements models, while maintaining completeness and consistency. We consider a theory as the deductive closure of a given set of axioms and conclude that software engineering is concerned, in essence, with, building and managing large theories. This theory construction commences with the development of the requirements model which we view as a theory of some nonmonotonic logic. Requirements evolution then involves the mapping of one such theory to another. Exploiting the deductive power of the theory of belief revision and nonmonotonic reasoning we develop a formal description of this mapping, as well as the requirements engineering process itself. This work thus offers a rigorous approach to reasoning about requirements evolution and a important focus for defining semantically well founded methods and tools for the effective management of changing requirements.","1997","2025-03-26 12:56:59","2025-03-26 12:56:59","","","","","","","Requirements Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/isre.1997.566875","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditionally, policy specification has not been an explicit part of the software development process. This isolation of policy specification from software development often results in policies that are not in compliance with system requirements and/or organizational security and privacy policies, leaving the system vulnerable to data breaches. This paper presents the results and lessons learned from a case study that employs the Requirements-based Access Control Analysis and Policy Specification (ReCAPS) method to specify access control policies for a Web-based event registration system. The ReCAPS method aids software and security engineers in specifying access control policies derived from requirements specifications and other available sources. Our case study revealed that the ReCAPS method helps identify inconsistencies across various software artifacts, such as requirements specification, database design, and organizational security and privacy policies. Had these problems not been identified and resolved, they would have crippled later phases of software development, resulted in missing or incomplete system functionality, and compromised the system's security and privacy. This case study reinforces, validates, and extends our previous recommendations that access control policy specification should be an integral part of the software development process for information systems to achieve information assurance and improve the quality of the information system.","2006","2025-03-26 12:56:59","2025-03-26 12:56:59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/iwia.2006.7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For the past 40 years, the techniques, processes and methods of software development have been dominated by supply side issues, and as a result the software industry is oriented towards developers rather than users. Existing software maintenance processes are simply too slow to meet the needs of many businesses. To achieve the levels of functionality, flexibility and time to market of changes and updates required by users, a radical shift is required in the development of software, with a more demand-centric view leading to software which will be delivered as a service, within the framework of an open marketplace. Although there are some signs that this approach is being adopted by industry, it is in a very limited and restricted form. We summarise research that has resulted in a long term strategic view of software engineering innovation. Based on this foundation, we describe more recent work that has resulted in an innovative demand-led model for the future of software. We describe a service architecture in which components may be bound instantly, just at the time they are needed and then the binding may be disengaged. Such ultra late binding requires that many non-functional attributes of the software are capable of automatic negotiation and resolution. Some of these attributes have been demonstrated and amplified through a prototype implementation based on existing and available technology.","2001","2025-03-26 12:56:59","2025-03-26 12:56:59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/icsm.2001.972742","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our aim is to forge a synthesis of their best features and to develop this further to overcome remaining limitations. One important consideration is the multilayered nature of a complex case, which can involve direct evidence, ancillary evidence, evidence about ancillary evidence, etc. all of a number of different kinds. If all these features are represented in one diagram, the result can be messy and hard to interpret. In addition, there are often recurrent features and patterns of evidence and evidential relations, e.g. credibility processes or match identification (DNA, eyewitness evidence, etc.), that may appear, in identical or similar form, at many different places within the same network, or within several different networks, and it is wasteful to model all these individually. The recently introduced technology of ‘object-oriented BNs’ suggests a way of dealing with these problems. Any network can itself contain instances of other networks, the details of which can be hidden from view until information on their detailed structure is desired. Moreover, generic networks to represent recurrent patterns of evidence can be constructed once and for all and copied or edited for reuse as needed. We describe the potential of this mode of description to simplify the construction and display of complex legal cases. To facilitate our narrative, the celebrated Sacco and Vanzetti murder case is used to illustrate the various methods discussed.","2007","2025-03-26 12:56:59","2025-03-26 12:56:59","","","","","","","Law, Probability and Risk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1093/lpr/mgm005","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is not the case currently in most commercially oriented research and development organizations.

Elements are either processing, data, or connecting elements. Form is defined in terms of the properties of, and the relationships among, the elements --- that is, the constraints on the elements. The rationale provides the underlying basis for the architecture in terms of the system constraints, which most often derive from the system requirements. We discuss the components of the model in the context of both architectures and architectural styles and present an extended example to illustrate some important architecture and style considerations.

Handcrafted rules and a text mining tool are developed to extract the important features, such as concepts, measurements, effective dates and so on, and to incorporate them into the corpus.To compare and locate related provisions from different regulatory documents, we employ Information Retrieval techniques to combine generic features with domain knowledge. Structural information from regulations, such as the hierarchical organization of provisions and heavy referencing among provisions, are used to help improve the relatedness analysis. Results are obtained to illustrate the use of regulatory structure and domain knowledge in provision comparisons. Application to an e-rulemaking scenario for a rights-of-way drafted regulation is shown to demonstrate extended capabilities of the prototype system.","2005","2025-03-26 12:56:59","2025-03-26 12:56:59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1145/1165485.1165508","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some special features of legal knowledge-based systems pertinent to their evaluation are presented. The expected benefits of such evaluations are discussed. and some of the difficulties likely to be encountered are outlined.  The proceedings of four International Conferences on Artificial Intelligence and Law are analysed to determine the rate of reporting evaluations in non-theoretical papers. These papers had a low rate of consideration of evaluation issues reflecting common practice in research biased development environments. These results confirm that more attention to evaluation is needed in the legal knowledge based systems domain.  This paper foreshadows the development of an evaluation methodology tailored specifically for legal knowledge-based systems. Evaluation strategies beyond verification and validation are drawn upon, both from the international ISO/IEC 14598 and 9126 standards and also from previous work on evaluation models for knowledge-based systems.","2001","2025-03-26 12:56:59","2025-03-26 12:56:59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1145/383535.383553","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Madhavji","Impediments to Regulatory Compliance of Requirements in Contractual Systems Engineering Projects: A Case Study","","","","10.1145/2629432","","Large-scale contractual systems engineering projects often need to comply with myriad government regulations and standards as part of contractual obligations. A key activity in the requirements engineering (RE) process for such a project is to demonstrate that all relevant requirements have been elicited from the regulatory documents and have been traced to the contract as well as to the target system components. That is, the requirements have met regulatory compliance. However, there are impediments to achieving this level of compliance due to such complexity factors as voluminous contract, large number of regulatory documents, and multiple domains of the system. Little empirical research has been conducted in the scientific community on identifying these impediments. Knowing these impediments is a driver for change in the solutions domain (i.e., creating improved or new methods, tools, processes, etc.) to deal with such impediments. Through a case study of an industrial RE project, we have identified a number of key impediments to achieving regulatory compliance in a large-scale, complex, systems engineering project. This project is an upgrade of a rail infrastructure system. The key contribution of the article is a number of hitherto uncovered impediments described in qualitative and quantitative terms. The article also describes an artefact model, depicting key artefacts and relationships involved in such a compliance project. This model was created from data gathered and observations made in this compliance project. In addition, the article describes emergent metrics on regulatory compliance of requirements that can possibly be used for estimating the effort needed to achieve regulatory compliance of system requirements.","2015","2025-03-26 12:56:59","2025-03-26 12:56:59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1145/2629432","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previous works have pointed out that at least some laws seem not to be valid for these new environments and even Lehman has labeled those (up to the moment few) cases as anomalies and has suggested that further research is needed to clarify this issue. In this line, we consider in this paper a large set of libre (free, open source) software systems featuring a large community of users and developers. In particular, we analyze a number of projects found in literature up to now, including the Linux kernel. For comparison, we include other libre software kernels from the BSD family, and for completeness we consider a wider range of libre software applications. In the case of Linux and the other operating system kernels we have studied growth patterns also at the subsystem level. We have observed in the studied sample that super-linearity occurs only exceptionally, that many of the systems follow a linear growth pattern and that smooth growth is not that common. These results differ from the ones found generally in classical software evolution studies. Other behaviors and patterns give also a hint that development in the libre software world could follow different laws than those known, at least in some cases.","2005","2025-03-26 12:57:00","2025-03-26 12:57:00","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/iwpse.2005.17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"5LIJ9TKW","journalArticle","1985","Anne von der Lieth Gardner; Anne von der Lieth Gardner","An artificial intelligence approach to legal reasoning","","","","","","For artificial intelligence, understanding the forms of human reasoning is a central goal. Legal reasoning is a form that makes a new set of demands on artificial intelligence methods. Most importantly, a computer program that reasons about legal problems must be able to distinguish between questions it is competent to answer and questions that human lawyers could seriously argue either way. In addition, a program for analyzing legal problems should be able to use both general legal rules and decisions in past cases; and it should be able to work with technical concepts that are only partly defined and subject to shifts of meaning. Each of these requirements has wider applications in artificial intelligence, beyond the legal domain. This dissertation presents a computational framework for legal reasoning, within which such requirements can be accommodated. The development of the framework draws significantly on the philosophy of law, in which the elucidation of legal reasoning is an important topic. A key element of the framework is the legal distinction between hard cases and clear cases. In legal writing, this distinction has been taken for granted more often than it has been explored. Here, some initial heuristics are proposed by which a program might make the distinction. The dissertation also describes an implemented program based on the framework. For definiteness, the program is given the task of analyzing law examination problems concerning the formation of contracts by offer and acceptance. The program performs adequately on a narrow class of such problems and appears to be extensible to other areas. Thus, the research opens up a line of investigation that may prove fruitful for both artifical intelligence and legal philosophy.","1985","2025-03-26 12:57:00","2025-03-26 12:57:00","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=An%20artificial%20intelligence%20approach%20to%20legal%20reasoning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One reason is the increasing legal convergence between governments in the European Union, and the increasing traffic of people over borders of jurisdictions. Another reason is the increasing globalization of companies; Products and services are offered in many jurisdictions at the same time, and the product or service has to meet the provisions of all jurisdictions in which it is offered. In the E-POWER project relevant tax legislation and business processes are modeled in UML to improve the speed and efficiency with which the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration can implement decision support systems for internal use and for its clients. These conceptual models have also proven their usefulness for efficient and effective analysis of draft legislation. We are currently researching whether conceptual modeling can also be used to compare 'similar' legislation from different jurisdictions to improve the capacity of the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration to react to future consequences of increased movement of people, products, and money between EU member states and increased harmonization between tax authorities in Europe. In addition, addressing the problem of comparing models is also expected to improve our methodology for modeling legislation.

However, empathy did not prove nearly as advantageous and at times was detrimental to discovering a possible deal and achieving individual profit.

Conventional civil aerospace practice (as advocated by guidelines such as ARP4754 and ARP4671) promotes the application of Functional Hazard Assessment (FHA) to sets of statements of functional intent. Systematic hazard analysis of scenario-based requirements representations is less well understood. This paper discusses the principles and problems of hazard analysis and proposes an approach to conducting hazard analysis on use case requirements representations. Using the approach, it is possible to justifiably derive hazard-mitigation use cases as first class requirements from systematic hazard analysis of core design intent scenarios. An industrial example is used to illustrate the technique.","2001","2025-03-26 12:57:00","2025-03-26 12:57:00","","","","","","","Requirements Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/isre.2001.948563","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Leidner; Frank Schilder; Frank Schilder","Hunting for the Black Swan: Risk Mining from Text","","","","","","In the business world, analyzing and dealing with risk permeates all decisions and actions. However, to date, risk identification, the first step in the risk management cycle, has always been a manual activity with little to no intelligent software tool support. In addition, although companies are required to list risks to their business in their annual SEC filings in the USA, these descriptions are often very high-level and vague. In this paper, we introduce Risk Mining, which is the task of identifying a set of risks pertaining to a business area or entity. We argue that by combining Web mining and Information Extraction (IE) techniques, risks can be detected automatically before they materialize, thus providing valuable business intelligence. We describe a system that induces a risk taxonomy with concrete risks (e.g., interest rate changes) at its leaves and more abstract risks (e.g., financial risks) closer to its root node. The taxonomy is induced via a bootstrapping algorithms starting with a few seeds. The risk taxonomy is used by the system as input to a risk monitor that matches risk mentions in financial documents to the abstract risk types, thus bridging a lexical gap. Our system is able to automatically generate company specific ""risk maps"", which we demonstrate for a corpus of earnings report conference calls.","2010","2025-03-26 12:57:00","2025-03-26 12:57:00","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Hunting%20for%20the%20Black%20Swan:%20Risk%20Mining%20from%20Text","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is valuable not only in many professional contexts, such as the law, science, politics, and business, but also in everyday life. However, not many people are good arguers. In response to this, researchers and practitioners over the past 15–20 years have developed software tools both to support and teach argumentation. Some of these tools are used in individual fashion, to present students with the “rules” of argumentation in a particular domain and give them an opportunity to practice, while other tools are used in collaborative fashion, to facilitate communication and argumentation between multiple, and perhaps distant, participants. In this paper, we review the extensive literature on argumentation systems, both individual and collaborative, and both supportive and educational, with an eye toward particular aspects of the past work. More specifically, we review the types of argument representations that have been used, the various types of interaction design and ontologies that have been employed, and the system architecture issues that have been addressed. In addition, we discuss intelligent and automated features that have been imbued in past systems, such as automatically analyzing the quality of arguments and providing intelligent feedback to support and/or tutor argumentation. We also discuss a variety of empirical studies that have been done with argumentation systems, including, among other aspects, studies that have evaluated the effect of argument diagrams (e.g., textual versus graphical), different representations, and adaptive feedback on learning argumentation. Finally, we conclude by summarizing the “lessons learned” from this large and impressive body of work, particularly focusing on lessons for the CSCL research community and its ongoing efforts to develop computer-mediated collaborative argumentation systems.","2010","2025-03-26 12:57:00","2025-03-26 12:57:00","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/s11412-009-9080-x","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To augment existing analyses and to help developers identify relevant source code during a modification task, we have developed an approach that applies data mining techniques to determine change patterns - sets of files that were changed together frequently in the past - from the change history of the code base. Our hypothesis is that the change patterns can be used to recommend potentially relevant source code to a developer performing a modification task. We show that this approach can reveal valuable dependencies by applying the approach to the Eclipse and Mozilla open source projects and by evaluating the predictability and interestingness of the recommendations produced for actual modification tasks on these systems.","2004","2025-03-26 12:57:00","2025-03-26 12:57:00","","","","","","","IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/tse.2004.52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Requirements engineering is a task difficult enough when done locally--but it is even more difficult when cross-functional stakeholder groups specify requirements across cultural, language and time zone boundaries. This paper reports on a field study that investigated RE challenges introduced by the stakeholders' geographical distribution in a multi-site organisation. The goal was to examine RE practices in global software development, and to formulate recommendations for improvement as well as to provide directions for future research on methods and tools. Based on the empirical evidence, we have constructed a model of how remote communication and knowledge management, cultural diversity and time differences negatively impact requirements gathering, negotiations and specifications. Findings reveal that aspects such as a lack of a common understanding of requirements, together with a reduced awareness of a working local context, a trust level and an ability to share work artefacts significantly challenge the effective collaboration of remote stakeholders in negotiating a set of requirements that satisfies geographically distributed customers. The paper concludes with recommendations for improving RE practices in this setting.","2003","2025-03-26 12:57:00","2025-03-26 12:57:00","","","","","","","Requirements Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-003-0173-1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This work represents a first step towards building a comprehensive legal risk assessment system for parties involved in litigation. This technology will allow parties to optimize their case parameters to minimize their own risk, or to settle disputes out of court and thereby ease the burden on the judicial system. In addition, it will also help U.S. courts detect and fix any inherent biases in the system.   We model risk estimation as a relational classification problem using conditional random fields [6] to jointly estimate the risks of concurrent cases. We evaluate our model on data collected by the Stanford Intellectual Property Litigation Clearinghouse, which consists of over 4,200 IP lawsuits filed across 88 U.S. federal districts and ranging over 8 years, probably the largest legal data set reported in data mining research.

The method and the tool have been evaluated during the development of seventeen software projects involving about 150 students. We observed that although tools based on information retrieval provide a useful support for the identification of traceability links during software development, they are still far to support a complete semi-automatic recovery of all links.

Three concepts are introduced: evolution histories, growth-plans and a propagation-directive calculus. Evolution histories describe a sequence of development phases of an object-oriented program, each phase being executable and therefore testable. To keep the programs flexible and short, they are described in terms of propagation patterns. Each phase of an evolution history is tested in small steps that are constrained by class dictionary graphs belonging to a growth-plan. Propagation directives are useful for describing both propagation patterns and growth-plans and are therefore endowed with sufficient expressiveness by being given a formal calculus applicable to object-oriented programming in general.

The paper gives a formal reconstruction of some fundamental patterns of legal reasoning, intended to reconcile symbolic logic and argumentation theory. Legal norms are represented as unidirectional inference rules which can be combined into arguments. The value of each argument (its qualification as justified, defensible, or defeated) is determined by the importance of the rules it contains. Applicability arguments, intended to contest or support the applicability of norms, preference arguments, purporting to establish preference relations among norms, and interpretative arguments are also formalised. All those argument types are connected in a unitary model, which relates legal reasoning to the indeterminacy of legal systems, intended as the possibility to develop incompatible defensible arguments.

Detecting and resolving inconsistencies is only part of the problem: a resolved inconsistency might not stay resolved. Frameworks in which inconsistency is tolerated help by allowing resolution to be delayed. However, evolution of a specification may affect both resolved and unresolved inconsistencies. We address these problems by explicitly recording relationships between partial specifications (ViewPoints), representing both resolved and unresolved inconsistencies. We assume that ViewPoints will often be inconsistent with one another, and we ensure that a complete work record is kept, detailing any inconsistencies that have been detected, and what actions, if any, have been taken to resolve them. The work record is then used to reason about the effects of subsequent changes to ViewPoints, without constraining the development process.","1995","2025-03-26 12:57:00","2025-03-26 12:57:00","","","","","","","Requirements Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/isre.1995.512545","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The research consists of two parts. First, weuse data from source control systems, defect tracking systems, andarchived project documentation to test a series of hypotheses developed by Belady and Lehman about software evolution. We find empirical support for many of these hypotheses, but not all. We then further analyze the data using moderated regression analysis to discern how software process automation efforts at the research site influenced the software evolution lifecycles of the applications. Our results support the claim that automation has enabled the organization to accomplish more work activities with greater productivity, thereby significantly increasing the functionality of the applications portfolio. Despite the growth in software functionality, the analysis suggests that automation has helped to manage software complexity levels and to improve quality by reducing errors over time. Our models and their results demonstrate how longitudinal empirical software data can be used to reveal the often elusive long-term benefits of investments in software process improvement, and to help managers make more informed resource-allocation decisions.

The traceability infrastructure underlying a software system tends to erode over its lifetime, as time-pressured practitioners fail to consistently maintain links and update impacted artifacts each time a change occurs, even with the support of automated systems. This paper proposes a new method of traceability based upon event-notification and is applicable even in a heterogeneous and globally distributed development environment. Traceable artifacts are no longer tightly coupled but are linked through an event service, which creates an environment in which change is handled more efficiently, and artifacts and their related links are maintained in a restorable state. The method also supports enhanced project management for the process of updating and maintaining the system artifacts.","2003","2025-03-26 12:57:01","2025-03-26 12:57:01","","","","","","","IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/tse.2003.1232285","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding the operation of precedent is important for our theorizing about the nature of law, since any adequate theory must be compatible with the practice. In this paper I will explore the conventional view of precedent endorsed by practitioners and many legal philosophers alike. I will argue that for all its attractions, it provides a distorted view of the nature of precedent. The distortion grows out of the basic assumption that precedents create rules, and thus that the common law can be understood as a form of rule-based decision-making. Instead, the common law is a form of case-by-case decision-making, and the doctrine of precedent constrains this decision-making by requiring later courts to treat earlier cases as correctly decided. The relevance of earlier cases is not well understood in terms of rules—they are better understood as a special type of reason.","2005","2025-03-26 12:57:01","2025-03-26 12:57:01","","","","","","","Legal Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1017/s1352325205050019","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A formal model is proposed that combines artificial intelligence formalisms for abductive inference to the best explanation and for defeasible argumentation. Stories about what might have happened in a case are represented as causal networks and possible hypotheses can be inferred by abductive reasoning. Links between stories and the available evidence are expressed with evidential generalizations that express how observations can be inferred from evidential sources with defeasible argumentation. It is argued that this approach unifies two well-known accounts of reasoning about evidence, namely, anchored narratives theory and new evidence theory.

Hence, the unit of analysis is widened from sectoral systems of innovation to socio-technical systems. The second contribution is to suggest an analytical distinction between systems, actors involved in them, and the institutions which guide actor’s perceptions and activities. Thirdly, the article opens up the black box of institutions, making them an integral part of the analysis. Institutions should not just be used to explain inertia and stability. They can also be used to conceptualise the dynamic interplay between actors and structures. The fourth contribution is to address issues of change from one system to another. The article provides a coherent conceptual multi-level perspective, using insights from sociology, institutional theory and innovation studies. The perspective is particularly useful to analyse long-term dynamics, shifts from one socio-technical system to another and the co-evolution of technology and society.","2004","2025-03-26 12:57:01","2025-03-26 12:57:01","","","","","","","Research Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.respol.2004.01.015","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This objective is achieved by disseminating the tasks and associated privileges for a specific business process among multiple users. This principle is demonstrated in the traditional example of separation of duty found in the requirement of two signatures on a check. Previous work on separation of duty requirements often explored implementations based on role-based access control (RBAC) principles. These implementations are concerned with constraining the associations between RBAC components, namely users, roles, and permissions. Enforcement of the separation of duty requirements, although an integrity requirement, thus relies on an access control service that is sensitive to the separation of duty requirements. A distinction between separation of duty requirements that can be enforced in administrative environments, namely static separation of duty, and requirements that can only be enforced in a run-time environment, namely dynamic separation of duty, is required. It is argued that RBAC does not support the complex work processes often associated with separation of duty requirements, particularly with dynamic separation of duty. The workflow environment, being primarily concerned with the facilitation of complex work processes, provides a context in which the specification of separation of duty requirements can be studied. This paper presents the ""conflicting entities"" administration paradigm for the specification of static and dynamic separation of duty requirements in the workflow environment.","2001","2025-03-26 12:57:01","2025-03-26 12:57:01","","","","","","","Ibm Systems Journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1147/sj.403.0666","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, this does not seem adequate for legal argumentation. Some proposals have suggested regulating attack relations using preferences or values on arguments and which filter the attack relation, so that some attacks fail and so can be removed from the framework. This does not capture several important context related features of legal reasoning, such as how an audience can prefer or value an argument, yet be constrained by precedent or authority not to accept it. Nor does it explain how certain types of attack may not be allowed in a particular procedural context. For this reason, evaluation of the status of arguments within a given framework must be allowed to depend not only on the attack relations along with the preference or value of arguments, but also on the nature of the attacks and the context in which they are made. We present a means to represent these features, enabling us to account for a number of factors currently considered to be beyond the remit of formal argumentation frameworks. We give three examples of the use of approach: appealing a case, overruling a precedent, and rehearing of a case as a civil rather than criminal proceeding.","2009","2025-03-26 12:57:01","2025-03-26 12:57:01","","","","","","","Journal of Logic and Computation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1093/logcom/exp009","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the software community recognizes the growing need to identify consequences of these changes, impact analysis is making its way into the software process. Dependencies between software life cycle objects are becoming more numerous and complex as many software systems grow beyond a million of lines of code. Software change efforts are plagued with widely varying estimates for implementing software changes, since the impacts of the change are not readily known in advance. The introduction of software change impact analysis into the software process adds more fidelity to software change visibility, enabling more accurate software change estimates. The paper examines where impact analysis is applied during software changes and describes how impact analysis can be addressed in the software process.","1996","2025-03-26 12:57:01","2025-03-26 12:57:01","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/icsm.1996.564987","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is however difficult to develop and maintain these models, especially when many models overlap with each other. This becomes an even bigger challenge when a single, generic model is used to capture a family of related goal models but different evaluations are required for each individual family member. In this work, we use ITU-T's Goal-oriented Requirement Language (GRL) and the jUCMNav tool to illustrate the problem and to formulate a solution that exploits the flexibility of standard GRL. In addition, we report on our recent experience on the modeling of aerodrome regulations. We demonstrate the usefulness of specifying families of goal models to address challenges associated with the maintenance of models used in the regulatory domain. We finally define and illustrate a new tool-supported algorithm used to evaluate individual goal models that are members of the larger family model.","2012","2025-03-26 12:57:01","2025-03-26 12:57:01","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-36757-1_3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our systems are all based on a simple process of identifying the components that correspond between two sentences. Currently we use words (that is word forms), lemmas, distributional similar words and grammatical relations identified with a dependency parser. We submitted three systems. All systems only use open class words. Our first system (alignheuristic) tries to obtain a mapping between every open class token using all the above sources of information. Our second system (wordsim) uses a different algorithm and unlike alignheuristic, it does not use the dependency information. The third system (average) simply takes the average of the scores for each item from the other two systems to take advantage of the merits of both systems. For this reason we only provide a brief description of that. The results are promising, with Pearson's coefficients on each individual dataset ranging from .3765 to .7761 for our relatively simple heuristics based systems that do not require training on different datasets.

Frequent changes in requirements are not always caused by capricious clients (although sometimes they are). The root cause of requirements volatility is that many applications are attempting to automate domains that are only partly understood. As software design and development proceeds, the process of automation begins to expose these ill-defined situations. Therefore, although creeping requirements are troublesome, they are often a technical necessity. Several threads of research and some emerging technologies are aimed at either clarifying requirements earlier in development or minimizing the disruptive effect of changing requirements later.","1996","2025-03-26 12:57:01","2025-03-26 12:57:01","","","","","","","IEEE Computer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/2.507640","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, not all kinds of requirements are equally well supported by use case diagrams. They are good for functional requirements, but poorer at e.g., security requirements, which often concentrate on what should not happen in the system. With the advent of e- and m-commerce applications, security requirements are growing in importance, also for quite simple applications where a short lead time is important. Thus, it would be interesting to look into the possibility for applying use cases on this arena. The paper suggests how this can be done, extending the diagrams with misuse cases. This new construct makes it possible to represent actions that the system should prevent, together with those actions which it should support.","2000","2025-03-26 12:57:01","2025-03-26 12:57:01","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-004-0194-4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main contribution of this thesis is a formally precise, elegant, clean, well-defined system which exhibits a correct behavior when applied to the benchmark examples in the literature. Model-theoretic semantical issues have been addressed. The investigation on the theoretical issues has aided the study of how this kind of reasoner can be realized on a computer.

The structural constraint of isomorphism encourages mappings that maximize the consistency of relational corresondences between the elements of the two analogs. The constraint of semantic similarity supports mapping hypotheses to the degree that mapped predicates have similar meanings. The constraint of pragmatic centrality favors mappings involving elements the analogist believes to be important in order to achieve the purpose for which the analogy is being used. The theory is implemented in a computer program called ACME (Analogical Constraint Mapping Engine), which represents constraints by means of a network of supporting and competing hypotheses regarding what elements to map. A cooperative algorithm for parallel constraint satisfaction identities mapping hypotheses that collectively represent the overall mapping that best fits the interacting constraints. ACME has been applied to a wide range of examples that include problem analogies, analogical arguments, explanatory analogies, story analogies, formal analogies, and metaphors. ACME is sensitive to semantic and pragmatic information if it is available, and yet able to compute mappings between formally isomorphic analogs without any similar or identical elements. The theory is able to account for empirical findings regarding the impact of consistency and similarity on human processing of analogies.","1989","2025-03-26 12:57:01","2025-03-26 12:57:01","","","","","","","Cognitive Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1207/s15516709cog1303_1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Requirements modelling techniques can be used to help deal with the knowledge and reasoning needed in this earlier phase of requirements engineering. However most existing requirements techniques are intended more for the later phase of requirements engineering, which focuses on completeness, consistency, and automated verification of requirements. In contrast, the early phase aims to model and analyze stakeholder interests and how they might be addressed, or compromised, by various system-and-environment alternatives.

The new analysis supports, or better does not contradict, the laws of software evolution, suggesting that the 1970s approach to metric analysis of software evolution is still relevant today. It is hoped that FEAST/1 will provide a foundation for mastering the feedback aspects of the software evolution process, opening up new paths for process modelling and improvement.","1997","2025-03-26 12:57:02","2025-03-26 12:57:02","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/metric.1997.637156","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To guide the system rationally requires clinical research on a massive scale. Will HIPAA stimulate an advance in medical research so that we have evidence to guide our medical decisions and policies, or will it lead to Draconian restrictions that push the healthcare system toward a less rational, less informed approach? Medical practice evolved in the 20th century from an almost purely anecdote-based apprenticeship system to a system in which doctors were trained by learning the mechanisms of disease and serving apprenticeships in which they learned the “tools of the trade.” Records were kept on paper and, although classification of disorders has been critical to all areas of scientific study, attention to nomenclature has been largely unsystematic in medicine. In parallel, a complex array of computerized systems has been developed for the business side of medicine, with little connection to the actual delivery of care. The dissociation between clinical and billing systems reflects the incorrect idea, basic in medical training, that doctors, armed with knowledge of disease mechanisms, can practice medicine by using deductive reasoning with little need for empirical decision support. Most recently, the Internet and supporting information systems have revolutionized the nonmedical world. Compare the functioning of the banking industry versus that of the healthcare industry. Almost anyone with a bank account can withdraw funds or pay bills from anywhere on Earth via computer. Making sensitive information about people’s finances available is possible because of common nomenclature and data standards adopted by the finance industry. In contrast, the medical community is a haphazard mix of paper- and computer-based systems with multiple nomenclatures that do not allow the …","2003","2025-03-26 12:57:02","2025-03-26 12:57:02","","","","","","","Circulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12939241","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To assist organizations in addressing this issue, our human-centered research has focused on understanding organizational privacy management needs, and, based on those needs, creating a usable and effective policy workbench called SPARCLE. SPARCLE will enable organizational users to enter policies in natural language, parse the policies to identify policy elements and then generate a machine readable (XML) version of the policy. In the future, SPARCLE will then enable mapping of policies to the organization's configuration and provide audit and compliance tools to ensure that the policy implementation operates as intended. In this paper, we present the strategies employed in the design and implementation of the natural language parsing capabilities that are part of the functional version of the SPARCLE authoring utility. We have created a set of grammars which execute on a shallow parser that are designed to identify the rule elements in privacy policy rules. We present empirical usability evaluation data from target organizational users of the SPARCLE system and highlight the parsing accuracy of the system with the organizations' privacy policies. The successful implementation of the parsing capabilities is an important step towards our goal of providing a usable and effective method for organizations to link the natural language version of privacy policies to their implementation, and subsequent verification through compliance auditing of the enforcement logs.","2006","2025-03-26 12:57:02","2025-03-26 12:57:02","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1145/1143120.1143123","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Reasoning about statistics and probabilities in a forensic science setting can be a precarious exercise, especially so when independencies between variables are involved. To facilitate the correct explanation of such evidence we investigate how argumentation models can help in the interpretation of statistical information. In this paper we focus on the connection between argumentation models and Bayesian belief networks, the latter being a common model to represent and reason with complex probabilistic information. We introduce the notion of a support graph as an intermediate structure between Bayesian networks and argumentation models. A support graph disentangles the complicating graphical properties of a Bayesian network and enhances its intuitive interpretation. Moreover, we show that this model can provide a suitable template for argumentative analysis. Especially in the context of legal reasoning, the correct treatment of statistical evidence is important.","2015","2025-03-26 12:57:02","2025-03-26 12:57:02","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1145/2746090.2746093","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Usually the knowledge is collected by knowledge engineers who are forced to make their own interpretations of the knowledge in order to map it on a knowledge representation technique, thus resulting into erroneous and legally unacceptable interpretations of the law. The aim of NOMOS (an EC supported project under the ESPRIT II initiative) was to assist the knowledge engineer by providng tools that perform semi-automatic knowledge acquisition from legal texts in Italian and French. This paper reports on the results of the first evaluation of the knowledge collected by these tools. The evaluation was performed by complementing the tools with a fully functional expert system  that accepted the generated knowledge bases and allowed experts to test the completeness of the knowledge through a series of interactive consultations. The knowledge base used for this evaluation was derived from the text for the Italian Value Added Tax Law. The text was pre-processed in its ASCII form by the Nomos tools and the generated knowledge base was filtered through to a conventional expert system shell to generate the evaluation expert system.  Knowledge extracted directly from text was converted into a hybrid of production rules and Conceptual Graphs. [see SOWA 1984] Knowledge collected from other sources, such as previously resolved cases, explanations of terms and examples, were linked to the knowledge base using an automated hypertext technique.

The set A may be finite or infinite in general, however, given the introductory purpose of this chapter, we will restrict the presentation to the case of finite sets of arguments. An argumentation framework has an obvious representation as a directed graph where nodes are arguments and edges are drawn from attacking to attacked arguments. A simple example of argumentation framework AF1 = 〈{a,b},{(b,a)}〉 is shown in Figure 1. While the word argument may recall several intuitive meanings, like the ones of “line of reasoning leading from some premise to a conclusion” or of “utterance in a dispute”, abstract argument systems are not (even implicitly or indirectly) bound to any of them: an abstract argument is not assumed to have any specific structure but, roughly speaking, an argument is anything that may attack or be attacked by another argument. Accordingly, the argumentation framework depicted in Figure 1 is suitable to represent many different situations.

Bench-Capon; Giovanni Sartor; Giovanni Sartor","Using values and theories to resolve disagreement in law 1","","","","","","In this paper we describe a novel approach to reasoning with cases and precedents. The approach is intended to address two main problems. First we find that current case based reasoning systems tend to offer relatively little support in determining the outcome of a case. They either present a list of cases which may inform, but cannot determine, the outcome, or else, as in HYPO and its successors ((1), (2), (3)), present arguments for both sides of a question leaving it the user to decide which is the more persuasive. What is lacking from these accounts is a notion of what it is that makes an argument persuasive. This is addressed in the context of AI and Law by Berman and Hafner in (4), and in law generally by Perelman (e.g. (5)). For Berman and Hafner an argument is made persuasive by supporting the purposes that the law is designed for, and for Perelman it is by advancing or protecting values that its audience subscribes to (on teleological argument, see also (6)). We believe these things to be effectively the same: the purpose of a law is typically to advance or promote some desired value, and the audience is the community subject to the law. Thus our first goal is to provide a model of case based reasoning in which we can use purposes and values to explain disagreements and their resolution. The second problem is the lack of the notion of context in many of the existing case based reasoning systems. A given case is decided in the context both of relevant past cases, which can supply precedents which will inform the decision, and in the context of future cases to which it will be relevant and possibly act as a precedent. A case is thus supposed to cohere with both past decisions and future decisions. This context is largely lost if we state the question as being whether one bundle of factors is more similar to the factors of a current case than another bundle, as in HYPO, or whether one rule is preferred to another, as in logical reconstructions of such systems, for example that of (7)). Recognition of context is vital if we are to understand accounts of legal reasoning (e.g. (8)) in which it is 1 This paper represents current on-going work investigating argument in case law.

Resolving such inconsistencies sooner or later in the process is a necessary condition for successful development of the software implementing those requirements. The paper first reviews the main types of inconsistency that can arise during requirements elaboration, defining them in an integrated framework and exploring their interrelationships. It then concentrates on the specific case of conflicting formulations of goals and requirements among different stakeholder viewpoints or within a single viewpoint. A frequent, weaker form of conflict called divergence is introduced and studied in depth. Formal techniques and heuristics are proposed for detecting conflicts and divergences from specifications of goals/requirements and of domain properties. Various techniques are then discussed for resolving conflicts and divergences systematically by the introduction of new goals or by transforming the specifications of goals/objects toward conflict-free versions. Numerous examples are given throughout the paper to illustrate the practical relevance of the concepts and techniques presented.

Substantial effort is spent on establishing and updating such links in any large project - even more so when requirements refer to a product family. [Question/problem]While most research is concerned with ways to reduce the effort needed to establish and maintain traceability links, a different question can also be asked: how is it possible to harness the vast amount of implicit (and tacit) knowledge embedded in already-established links? Is there something to be learned about a specific problem or domain, or about the humans who establish traces, by studying such traces? [Principal ideas/results] In this paper, we present preliminary results from a study applying different machine learning techniques to an industrial case study, and test to what degree common hypothesis hold in our case.

In this article, we propose an approach and tool support for automated detection and resolution of cross references. The approach leverages the structure of legal texts, formalized into a schema, and a set of natural language patterns for legal cross reference expressions. These patterns were developed based on an investigation of Luxembourg's legislation, written in French. To build confidence about their applicability beyond the context where they were observed, these patterns were validated against the Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA) by the Government of Ontario, Canada, written in both French and English.

To cope with such an environment, it is moving from a traditional evolutionary to a systems engineering approach. Great effort is being made for a shift from the traditional component focus, which has been enhanced by concurrent engineering, to a more broadened view supported by systems thinking. This broader view, however, is in practice strongly focused on the product elements of the system. This paper proposes a systems engineering framework for integrated automotive development—the total view approach. It is a modeling framework that integrates the product, its life cycle processes and their associated organizations throughout the requirements, functional and physical analysis processes, at all levels of the product breakdown structure, deriving attributes as emergent properties of a whole integrated system. The paper justifies the framework through a review of traditional and current automotive development and two case studies. A major benefit of the application of the framework is the ability to investigate early in the product development process the interactions between requirements and attributes not only of the product, but also of its life cycle processes and their associated organisations. This can lead to better product quality, lower life cycle cost, shorter development time, and manageable complexity. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This framework is intended to help checking whether governance systems are consistent with the law. The framework proposes legal and enterprise models, a governance analysis method - called GAM -, in addition to a governance analysis language - called GAL -, and an implemented governance analysis tool - called GAT. The method consists in extracting requirements into GAL statements by using patterns and translating them into a logic model for consistency checking.  The models, language, and tool proposed in this thesis evolved as a result of their application to governance laws (privacy and financial). The method's main processes were validated through application to Canadian and US laws (mainly PIPEDA and Sarbanes-Oxley) combined with various examples taken from enterprise systems. From these evaluations it was concluded that the method is formal, and repeatable for the purposes of partially extracting requirements from laws and enterprises, directly mapping these combined requirements into logic models, and checking results. The extraction process uses patterns to match legal and enterprise requirements. The representation process maps extracted requirements to GAL statements. The generation process takes as input GAL statements to generate a logic model. The Alloy logic analyser is then used to check legal consistency. Three legal-compliance validation techniques are proposed: model, ontology, and scenario checks. Model-checks validate the combined legal and enterprise requirements for logical consistency. Ontology-checks validate the enterprise structure and process. Scenario-checks validate enterprise scenarios. The techniques are shown to be useful for identifying conflicts and extracting counterexamples.","2009","2025-03-26 12:57:03","2025-03-26 12:57:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.20381/ruor-13155","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, we collected legal requirements that are stable concerning changes due to their origin in fundamental, higher-ranked laws, and derived software requirement patterns from them.

The main challenge in the extraction of conceptual graphs from the natural language texts is the automatic identification of concepts and conceptual relations. The text analyzed in this work are patent documents, focused mainly on the claim's section (Claim) of the documents. The task of automatically identifying the concept and conceptual relation becomes difficult due to the complexities in the writing style of these documents as they are technical as well as legal. The analysis we have done shows that the general in-depth parsers available in the open domain fail to parse the 'claims section' sentences in patent documents. The failure of in-depth parsers led us, to develop a methodology to extract CGs using shallow parsed text. Thus in the present work we came up with a methodology which uses shallow parsed text in conjunction with DBMs, a deep learning technique for extracting CGs from sentences in the claim/novelty section of patent documents. The results obtained in our experiments are encouraging with a significant improvement over the state -of-art and are discussed in detail in this paper. We have obtained a precision of 79.34 % and a recall of 72.54%.","2015","2025-03-26 12:57:03","2025-03-26 12:57:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1145/2838706.2838711","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Massey","Legal requirements metrics for compliance analysis","","","","","","Laws and regulations safeguard citizens’ security and privacy. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) 1 governs the security and privacy of electronic health records (EHR) systems. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which is charged with creating, maintaining, and enforcing regulations pursuant to HIPAA, has required systematic changes in institutional privacy practices as a result of nearly 15,000 resolved HIPAA investigations.2 HIPAA violations can result in serious monetary penalties. HHS recently fined one healthcare provider $4.3 million dollars for violations of the HIPAA Privacy Rule.3 Ensuring EHR systems are legally compliant is challenging for software engineers because the laws and regulations governing EHR systems are written by lawyers with little to no understanding of the underlying technology.  This dissertation examines how software engineers can evaluate software requirements for compliance with laws and regulations. The main objective of this work is to help software engineers perform a legal compliance analysis for software intended to be deployed in domains goverened by law by developing empirically validated: (a) techniques for determining which requirements are legally implementation ready (LIR);4 (b) metrics to estimate which requirements are LIR automatically; and (c) a prototype tool that supports identifying LIR requirements using legal requirements metrics. My empirical studies suggest that the average graduate-level software engineer is illprepared to identify legally compliant software requirements with any confidence and that domain experts are an absolute necessity. When working together as a team graduate-level software engineers make extremely conservative legal implementation readiness decisions. Furthermore, we observe that the legal requirements metrics discussed in this dissertation can be used to improve legal implementation readiness decisions. These findings, along with legal and ethical concerns, make the study of legal compliance in software engineering a critical area for continued research. 1 Pub.L.No.104-191,110Stat.1936(1996). 2 http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/enforcement/highlights/index.html. 3 http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2011pres/02/20110222a.html. 4 Legally implementation ready requirements are requirements that have met or exceeded their obligations under relevant laws and regulations.","2012","2025-03-26 12:57:03","2025-03-26 12:57:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Legal%20requirements%20metrics%20for%20compliance%20analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We review how this mechanism works and also look into smart contracts—scripts that reside on the blockchain that allow for the automation of multi-step processes. We then move into the IoT domain, and describe how a blockchain-IoT combination: 1) facilitates the sharing of services and resources leading to the creation of a marketplace of services between devices and 2) allows us to automate in a cryptographically verifiable manner several existing, time-consuming workflows. We also point out certain issues that should be considered before the deployment of a blockchain network in an IoT setting: from transactional privacy to the expected value of the digitized assets traded on the network. Wherever applicable, we identify solutions and workarounds. Our conclusion is that the blockchain-IoT combination is powerful and can cause significant transformations across several industries, paving the way for new business models and novel, distributed applications.","2016","2025-03-26 12:57:03","2025-03-26 12:57:03","","","","","","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2016.2566339","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ADFs generalise the abstract argumentation frameworks introduced by Dung by replacing Dung’s single acceptance condition (that all attackers be defeated) with acceptance conditions local to each particular node.

There are many approaches dealing with both problems but most of them rely on word or concept distribution over Wikipedia. They are therefore not applicable to concepts that do not have a rich textual description. In this paper, we show that semantic relatedness can also be accurately computed by analysing only the graph structure of the knowledge base. In addition, we propose a joint approach to entity and word-sense disambiguation that makes use of graph-based relatedness. As opposed to the majority of state-of-the-art systems that target mainly named entities, we use our approach to disambiguate both entities and common nouns. In our experiments, we first validate our relatedness measure on multiple knowledge bases and ground truth datasets and show that it performs better than related state-of-the-art graph based measures. Afterwards, we evaluate the disambiguation algorithm and show that it also achieves superior disambiguation accuracy with respect to alternative state-of-the-art graph-based algorithms.","2015","2025-03-26 12:57:03","2025-03-26 12:57:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-25007-6_26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With this growth in public policy, questions regarding the effectiveness of these policies arise. This chapter focuses on policy analysis of the state data breach disclosure laws recently enacted in the United States. The state data breach disclosure laws were chosen for policy analysis for three reasons: the rapid policy growth (the United States have enacted 45 state laws in 6 years); this is the first instantiation of informational regulation for information security; and the importance of these laws to identity theft and privacy. The chapter begins with a brief history in order to provide context. Then, this chapter examines the way in which historical, political and institutional factors have shaped our current data breach disclosure policies, focusing on discovering how patterns of interaction influenced the legislative outcomes we see today. Finally, this chapter considers: action that may result from these policies; the action type(s) being targeted; alternatives that are being considered, and; potential outcomes of the existing and proposed alternative policies.","2012","2025-03-26 12:57:03","2025-03-26 12:57:03","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.4018/978-1-61350-323-2.ch302","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By exploring the notion of multiple levels of granularity, one can identify, examine and formalize a special family of principles, strategies, heuristics, and methods that are commonly used by humans in daily problem solving. The results may then be used for human and machine problem solving, as well as for implementing human-inspired approaches in machines and systems. The triarchic theory of granular computing unifies both types of studies from three perspectives, namely, a philosophy of structured thinking, a methodology of structured problem solving, and a computation paradigm of structured information processing. The stress on multilevel, hierarchical structures makes granular computing a human-inspired and structured approach to problem solving.","2010","2025-03-26 12:57:04","2025-03-26 12:57:04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.4018/978-1-60566-324-1.ch001","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An algorithm to generate finite state machines (FSM) from stakeholder rights and obligations for compliance monitoring is proposed. Rights and obligations define what people are permitted or required to do; these rights and obligations affect software requirements and design. The FSM allows stakeholders, software developers and compliance officers to trace events through the invocation of rights and obligations as preand postconditions. Compliance is monitored by instrumenting runtime systems to report these events and detect violations. Requirements and software engineers specify the rights and obligations, and our algorithm performs three supporting tasks: 1) identify ambiguities, 2) balance rights with obligations, and 3) generate finite state machines. Preliminary validation of the algorithm includes FSMs generated from U.S. healthcare regulations and tool support to parse these specifications and generate the FSMs.","2006","2025-03-26 12:57:04","2025-03-26 12:57:04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=An%20algorithm%20to%20generate%20compliance%20monitors%20from%20regulations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This can be useful, for both lawyers and judges, as an assisting tool to rapidly identify cases and extract patterns which lead to certain decisions. This paper presents the first systematic study on predicting the outcome of cases tried by the European Court of Human Rights based solely on textual content. We formulate a binary classification task where the input of our classifiers is the textual content extracted from a case and the target output is the actual judgment as to whether there has been a violation of an article of the convention of human rights. Textual information is represented using contiguous word sequences, i.e., N-grams, and topics. Our models can predict the court’s decisions with a strong accuracy (79% on average). Our empirical analysis indicates that the formal facts of a case are the most important predictive factor. This is consistent with the theory of legal realism suggesting that judicial decision-making is significantly affected by the stimulus of the facts. We also observe that the topical content of a case is another important feature in this classification task and explore this relationship further by conducting a qualitative analysis.","2016","2025-03-26 12:57:04","2025-03-26 12:57:04","","","","","","","PeerJ","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.93","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"UWPQ4WFW","journalArticle","2014","K Teerapong","Graphical ways of researching","","","","","","This paper investigates the ways in which graphic design can be understood as a process of inquiry. Although the use of visuals has been widely accepted in research in various fields, researchers in sciences and humanities tend to position graphic design as a communication tool rather than a research strategy. Thus, the main purpose of adopting graphic works is often for visual presentations. As an emerging discipline with a lack of theoretical engagement (Noble & Bestley 2011), graphic design is overshadowed and its functions and implications have not been fully recognized. This essay aims to explicate knowledge from the graphic design process and understand the term 'graphic design' as a research strategy. In so doing, a clear distinction between two research areas which use visuals in their methodologies needs to be identified. The first is graphic design research which directly links to visuals and graphic design practices. This can refer to a practice-led paradigm so that the designer researchers can discover knowledge through their practices. The second is the research that uses visual data and/or visual presentations. This type of research can vary from the sciences to humanities. In order to reposition graphic design in research methodology, it is important to clarify the difference between these two categories. This would offer potential for graphic design to be accepted as a discipline that has its design methodology.","2014","2025-03-26 12:57:04","2025-03-26 12:57:04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Graphical%20ways%20of%20researching","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, a KIM of PCD is presented in accordance with the characteristics of product design activities. Hereafter, a knowledge transformation method based on “problem domain – functional domain” model is developed to accurately reflect customer expectations for new products, wherein, knowledge ontology tree including “customer creativity, emotional knowledge, customer needs, and basic knowledge” is constructed to standardize customer needs. Then, a knowledge matching function (KMF) and a Backus–Naur form (BNF) are introduced to measure similarity of request and candidate. Thereafter, a service engine (SE) including KMF and BNF is generated by the knowledge integrated system (KIS). Finally, simulations and experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and models.","2017","2025-03-26 12:57:04","2025-03-26 12:57:04","","","","","","","Journal of intelligent systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1515/jisys-2015-0046","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Reed","Computer representations of design standards and building codes: a U.S. perspective","","","","","","Standards representation and processing in the United States has had a long and interesting history of                       development. The work in the past has focused primarily on representing a standard, evaluating the intrinsic                       properties of that represented standard, and evaluating designs for conformance to that standard. To date, for a                       variety of reasons, standards writing organizations and computer-aided design software vendors have not                       adopted much of the results of this research. The failure of the approach so far in the U.S. can be traced to two                       distinct areas. One major cluster of causes is methodological: the initial concepts were not backed up by usable,                       persistent computer tools; and the initial application and model were not representative. The second cluster of                       causes of failure is professional, and has a lot to do with the dynamics of interaction of individuals and                       organizations. Future research must address the inadequacies of the current representations and create models                       that are able to represent all, or almost all, of the different types of provisions in any given standard; investigate                       and deliver a much richer set of processing functionality's, such as more support for use of design standards in                       earlier phases of design; support the treatment of multiple, heterogeneous standards available from distributed                       sources; and determine what type of support is needed to go from the textual versions of design standards to the                       formal models that can support sophisticated computation.","1995","2025-03-26 12:57:04","2025-03-26 12:57:04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Computer%20representations%20of%20design%20standards%20and%20building%20codes:%20a%20U.S.%20perspective","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current approaches to norms in multi-agent systems tend either to simply make prohibited actions unavailable, or to provide a set of rules (principles) which the agent is obliged to follow, either as part of its design or to avoid sanctions and punishments. In this paper we argue for the position that agents should be equipped with the ability to reason about a system's norms, by reasoning about the social and moral values that norms are designed to serve; that is, perform the sort of moral reasoning we expect of humans. In particular we highlight the need for such reasoning when circumstances are such that the rules should arguably be broken, so that the reasoning can guide agents in deciding whether to comply with the norms and, if violation is desirable, how best to violate them. One approach to enabling this is to make use of an argumentation scheme based on values and designed for practical reasoning: arguments for and against actions are generated using this scheme and agents choose between actions based on their preferences over these values. Moral reasoning then requires that agents have an acceptable set of values and an acceptable ordering on their values. We first discuss how this approach can be used to think about and justify norms in general, and then discuss how this reasoning can be used to think about when norms should be violated, and the form this violation should take. We illustrate how value based reasoning can be used to decide when and how to violate a norm using a road traffic example. We also briefly consider what makes an ordering on values acceptable, and how such an ordering might be determined.","2017","2025-03-26 12:57:04","2025-03-26 12:57:04","","","","","","","Artificial Intelligence and Law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10506-017-9194-9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Analytic methods for the correct handling of evidence come in different styles, typically focusing on one of three tools: arguments, scenarios or probabilities. Recent research used Bayesian networks for connecting arguments, scenarios, and probabilities. Well-known issues with Bayesian networks were encountered: More numbers are needed than are available, and there is a risk of misinterpretation of the graph underlying the Bayesian network, for instance as a causal model. The formalism presented here models presumptive arguments about coherent hypotheses that are compared in terms of their strength. No choice is needed between qualitative or quantitative analytic styles, since the formalism can be interpreted with and without numbers. The formalism is applied to key concepts in argumentative, scenario and probabilistic analyses of evidential reasoning, and is illustrated with a fictional crime investigation example based on Alfred Hitchcock's film `To Catch A Thief'.","2017","2025-03-26 12:57:04","2025-03-26 12:57:04","","","","","","","Artificial Intelligence and Law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10506-017-9199-4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"JKDK7SF8","journalArticle","2017","LM Al Abdulkarim; LM Al-Abdulkarim; LM Al Abdulkarim; Latifa Al-Abdulkarim","Representation of case law for argumentative reasoning","","","","","","Modelling argumentation based on legal cases has been a central topic of AI and Law since its very beginnings. The current established view is that facts must be determined on the basis of evidence. Next, these facts must be used to ascribe legally significant predicates (factors and issues) to the case, on the basis of which the outcome can be established. This thesis aims to provide a method to encapsulate the knowledge of bodies of case law from various legal domains using a recent development in AI knowledge representation, Abstract Dialectical Frameworks (ADFs), as the central feature of the design method. Three legal domains in the US Courts are used throughout the thesis: The domain of the Automobile Exception to the Fourth Amendment, which has been freshly analysed in terms of factors in this thesis; the US Trade Secrets domain analysed from well-known legal case-based reasoning systems (CATO and IBP); and the Wild Animals domain analysed extensively in AI and Law. In this work, ADFs play a role akin to that of Entity-Relationship models in the design of database systems to design and implement programs intended to decide cases, described as sets of factors, according to a theory of a particular domain based on a set of precedent cases relating to that domain. The ADFs in this thesis are instantiated from different starting points: factor-based representation of oral dialogues and factor-based analysis of legal opinions. A legal dialogue representation model is defined for the US Supreme Court Oral Hearing dialogues. The role of these hearings is to identify the components that can form the basis of an argument that will resolve the case. Dialogue moves used by participants have been identified as the dialogue proceeds to assert and modify argument components in term of issues, factors and facts, and to produce what are called Argument Component Trees (ACTs) for each participant in the dialogue, showing how these components relate to one another. The resulting trees can be then merged and used as input to decide the accepted components using an ADF. The model is illustrated using two landmark case studies in the Automobile Exception domain: Carney v. California and US v. Chadwick. A legal justification model is defined to capture knowledge in a legal domain and to provide justification and transparency of legal decisions. First, a legal domain ADF is instantiated from the factor hierarchy of CATO and IBP, then the method is applied to the other two legal domains. In each domain, the cases are expressed in terms of factors organised into an ADF, from which an executable program can be implemented in a straightforward way by taking advantage of the closeness of the acceptance conditions of the ADF to components of an executable program. The proposed method is evaluated to test the ease of implementation, the efficacy of the resulting program, the ease of refinement, transparency of the reasoning and transferability across legal domains. This evaluation suggests ways of improving the decision by incorporating the case facts, and considering justification and reasoning using portions of precedents. The final result is ANGELIC (ADF for kNowledGe Encapsulation of Legal Information from Cases), a method for producing programs that decide the cases with a high degree of accuracy in multiple domains.","2017","2025-03-26 12:57:04","2025-03-26 12:57:04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Representation%20of%20case%20law%20for%20argumentative%20reasoning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By nature, the language of law is strict, hence the predominant use of modal logic as a substitute for the syntactical ambiguity in natural language, specifically, deontic and alethic logic for the respective modalities. However, deontic modalities which express obligations, prohibitions and permissions, can have varying degree and preciseness to which they correspond to a matter, strict deontic logic does not allow for such quantitative measures. Therefore, this paper outlines a data-driven approach by classifying deontic modalities using ensembled Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) that incorporate domain specific legal distributional semantic model (DSM) representations, in combination with, a general DSM representation. We propose to use well calibrated probability estimates from these classifiers as an approximation to the degree which an obligation/prohibition or permission belongs to a given class based on SME annotated sentences.

Given that there are legal consequences attached to service contracts, understanding the elements of a contract is key to managing services in an enterprise. After all, provisions in a service contract establish obligations and rights for service providers and customers that must be respected in service delivery. The importance of service contracts to service provisioning in an enterprise has motivated us to investigate their representation in enterprise models. We have observed that approaches fall into two extremes of a spectrum. Some approaches, such as ArchiMate, offer an opaque ""contract"" construct, not revealing the rights and obligations in the scope of the governed service relationship. Other approaches, under the umbrella term ""contract languages"", are devoted exactly to the formal representation of the contents of contracts. Despite the applications of contract languages, they operate at a level of detail that does not match that of enterprise architecture models. In this paper, we explore the gap between these two extremes. We address the representation of service contract elements with a systematic approach: we first propose a well-founded service contract ontology, and then extend the ArchiMate language to reflect the elements of the service contract ontology. The applicability of the proposed extension is assessed in the representation of a real-world cloud service contract.","2017","2025-03-26 12:57:04","2025-03-26 12:57:04","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/edoc.2017.15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The account is constructed with the purpose of rectifying problems with the approach to incorporating dimensions in Horty (2017), namely, the problems arising from the collapse of the distinction between the reason model and the result model on that approach. Examination of the newly constructed theory revealed that the importance of dimensions in the reason model lies in their ability to establish weighings between reasons/factors of the same polarity. This permits past cases to constrain future cases in ways they could not on the reason model with just factors. The paper then discusses how dimensions might be established from a case base and how dimensions that are incomplete in various aspects might be dealt with in the theory. It closes with comparisons to other work in the literature on AI and Law and suggestions for further improvement of the reason model.","2018","2025-03-26 12:57:05","2025-03-26 12:57:05","","","","","","","Artificial Intelligence and Law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10506-017-9216-7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposed CLIEL environment operates using NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques, JAPE (Java Annotation Patterns Engine) rules and some GATE (General Architecture for Text Engineering) modules. The system is fully described and evaluated using a commercial law document corpus. The results demonstrate that considering the layout is beneficial for extracting data point instances from legal document collections.","2017","2025-03-26 12:57:05","2025-03-26 12:57:05","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1145/3086512.3086520","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Previously, surveys on BPC have been conducted with specific context in mind; however, the literature on BPC management research is largely sparse and does not accumulate a detailed understanding on existing literature and related issues faced by the domain. This survey provides a holistic view of the literature on existing BPC management approaches and categorises them based on different compliance management strategies in the context of formulated research questions. A systematic literature approach is used where search terms pertaining keywords were used to identify literature related to the research questions from scholarly databases. From initially 183 papers, we selected 79 papers related to the themes of this survey published between 2000 and 2015. The survey results reveal that mostly compliance management approaches centre around three distinct categories, namely design-time (\(28\%\)), run-time (\(32\%\)) and auditing (\(10\%\)). Also, organisational and internal control-based compliance management frameworks (\(21\%\)) and hybrid approaches make (\(9\%\)) of the surveyed approaches.

One of the key reasons is that software practitioners are reluctant to trust predictions produced by the analytics machinery without understanding the rationale for those predictions. While complex models such as deep learning and ensemble methods improve predictive performance, they have limited explainability. In this paper, we argue that making software analytics models explainable to software practitioners is as \emph{important} as achieving accurate predictions. Explainability should therefore be a key measure for evaluating software analytics models. We envision that explainability will be a key driver for developing software analytics models that are useful in practice.

As this domain continues to grow and mature, and with more modelling methods introduced to support compliance tasks, important questions need to be asked. What exactly are these methods used for? Where have they been applied? What benefits do they offer? This paper explores how goal-oriented and non-goal-oriented modelling methods have been used for legal and regulatory compliance, and identifies their main claimed benefits and drawbacks based on the kind of compliance tasks they perform. Using a systematic literature mapping approach, we evaluated 103 articles describing the use of modelling methods obtained from a pool of 286 articles. The results indicate that modelling methods focus on the intent of a law, but goal-oriented modelling methods do so while also reflecting the structure of a law, generally with substantial benefits for all compliance tasks. In addition, whereas modelling methods are used for compliance modelling, checking, analysis and enactment tasks, our analysis indicates that the coverage of these methods is more frequent in the healthcare domain with 55% of the articles reviewed targeting it. In terms of the contexts modelling methods address, privacy has the highest level of attention with a focus from 54% of the reviewed articles. The articles reviewed revealed a total of 60 different laws and regulations from 14 different countries, with 62% focusing on privacy. Moreover, while 82% of the articles reviewed addressed concerns of regulated parties, only 12% addressed the concerns of regulators, and 6% addressed concerns of both regulating and regulated parties. This study highlights the benefits and drawbacks of both types ofmodelling methods and identifies potential benefits and common drawbacks that will be of interest to researchers and practitioners in the selection of modelling methods or in the identification of selection criteria. Finally, the mapping results emphasize the need for more studies outside of healthcare, that are related to contexts other than privacy, that target compliance enactment tasks or that take the concerns of regulators into consideration.","2019","2025-03-26 12:57:05","2025-03-26 12:57:05","","","","","","","Requirements Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/s00766-018-0294-1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

SPESC can specify a smart contract in a similar form to real-world contracts using a natural-language-like grammar, in which the obligations and rights of parties and the transaction rules of cryptocurrencies are clearly defined.

This is because new technologies can provide them with robust solutions that are of benefit to citizens. Cities aim to incorporate smart systems in their industrial, infrastructural, educational, and social activities. A Smart City is managed with intelligent technologies which allow improving the quality of the services offered to citizens and make all processes more efficient. However, the Smart City concept is fairly recent. The ideas that it encompasses have not yet been consolidated due to the large number of fields and technologies that fit under this concept. All of this led to confusion about the definition of a Smart City and this is evident in the literature. This article explores the literature that addresses the topic of Smart Cities; a comprehensive analysis of the concept and existing platforms is performed. We gain a clear understanding of the services that a Smart City must provide, the technology it should employ for the development of these services, and the scope that this concept covers. Moreover, the shortcomings and needs of Smart Cities are identified and a model for designing a Smart City architecture is proposed. In addition, three case studies have been proposed: the first is a simulator to study the implementation of various services and technologies, the second case study to manage incidents that occur in a Smart City, and the third case study to monitor the deployment of large-scale sensors in a Smart City.","2018","2025-03-26 12:57:05","2025-03-26 12:57:05","","","","","","","Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1155/2018/3086854","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, argumentation mining is an important part of a complete argumentation analyisis, i.e. understanding the content of serial arguments, their linguistic structure, the relationship between the preceding and following arguments, recognizing the underlying conceptual beliefs, and understanding within the comprehensive coherence of the specific topic. We present different methods to aid argumentation mining, starting with plain argumentation detection and moving forward to a more structural analysis of the detected argumentation. Different state-of-the-art techniques on machine learning and context free grammars are applied to solve the challenges of argumentation mining. We also highlight fundamental questions found during our research and analyse different issues for future research on argumentation mining.","2011","2025-03-26 12:57:05","2025-03-26 12:57:05","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/s10506-010-9104-x","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"MGK5DDQ9","journalArticle","2008","Sunita Sarawagi; Sunita Sarawagi","Information Extraction","","","","10.1561/1900000003","","The automatic extraction of information from unstructured sources has opened up new avenues for querying, organizing, and analyzing data by drawing upon the clean semantics of structured databases and the abundance of unstructured data. The field of information extraction has its genesis in the natural language processing community where the primary impetus came from competitions centered around the recognition of named entities like people names and organization from news articles. As society became more data oriented with easy online access to both structured and unstructured data, new applications of structure extraction came around. Now, there is interest in converting our personal desktops to structured databases, the knowledge in scientific publications to structured records, and harnessing the Internet for structured fact finding queries. Consequently, there are many different communities of researchers bringing in techniques from machine learning, databases, information retrieval, and computational linguistics for various aspects of the information extraction problem. This review is a survey of information extraction research of over two decades from these diverse communities. We create a taxonomy of the field along various dimensions derived from the nature of the extraction task, the techniques used for extraction, the variety of input resources exploited, and the type of output produced. We elaborate on rule-based and statistical methods for entity and relationship extraction. In each case we highlight the different kinds of models for capturing the diversity of clues driving the recognition process and the algorithms for training and efficiently deploying the models. We survey techniques for optimizing the various steps in an information extraction pipeline, adapting to dynamic data, integrating with existing entities and handling uncertainty in the extraction process.","2008","2025-03-26 12:57:05","2025-03-26 12:57:05","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1561/1900000003","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The defeasibility of rules is expressed by means of non-provability claims as additional conditions of the rules. We outline an abstract approach to defeasible reasoning and argumentation which includes many existing formalisms, including default logic, extended logic programming, non-monotonic modal logic and auto-epistemic logic, as special cases. We show, in particular, that the `admissibility' semantics for all these formalisms has a natural argumentation-theoretic interpretation and proof procedure, which seem to correspond well with informal argumentation. In the admissibility semantics there is only one way for one argument to attack another, namely by undermining one of its non-provability claims. In this paper, we show how other kinds of attack between arguments, specifically how rebuttal and priority attacks, can be reduced to the undermining of non-provability claims.","1996","2025-03-26 12:57:05","2025-03-26 12:57:05","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/bf00118494","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we investigate the use of our metadata extraction framework as an enabler for smart legal search with a focus on requirements engineering activities. We report on our industrial experience helping the Government of Luxembourg provide an advanced search facility over Luxembourg's Income Tax Law. The experience shows that semantic legal metadata can be successfully exploited for answering requirements engineering-related legal queries.

Through the GDPR, individuals are able to better control their personal data in the face of new technological developments. While the GDPR is highly advantageous to individuals, complying with it poses major challenges for organizations that control or process personal data. Since no automated solution with broad industrial applicability currently exists for GDPR compliance checking, organizations have no choice but to perform costly manual audits to ensure compliance. In this paper, we share our experience building a UML representation of the GDPR as a first step towards the development of future automated methods for assessing compliance with the GDPR. Given that a concrete implementation of the GDPR is affected by the national laws of the EU member states, GDPR's expanding body of case law and other contextual information, we propose a two-tiered representation of the GDPR: a generic tier and a specialized tier. The generic tier captures the concepts and principles of the GDPR that apply to all contexts, whereas the specialized tier describes a specific tailoring of the generic tier to a given context, including the contextual variations that may impact the interpretation and application of the GDPR. We further present the challenges we faced in our modeling endeavor, the lessons we learned from it, and future directions for research.","2019","2025-03-26 12:57:06","2025-03-26 12:57:06","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/models.2019.00-20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper describes two approaches to an important form of legal decision support---explainable outcome prediction---that obviate both annotation of an entire decision corpus and manual processing of new cases. The first approach, which uses an Attention Network for prediction and attention weights to highlight salient case text, was shown to be capable of predicting decisions, but attention-weight-based text highlighting did not demonstrably improve human decision speed or accuracy in an evaluation with 61 human subjects. The second approach, termed SCALE (Semi-supervised Case Annotation for Legal Explanations), exploits structural and semantic regularities in case corpora to identify textual patterns that have both predictable relationships to case decisions and explanatory value.","2019","2025-03-26 12:57:06","2025-03-26 12:57:06","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1145/3322640.3326723","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of the key reasons is that software practitioners are reluctant to trust predictions produced by the analytics machinery without understanding the rationale for those predictions. While complex models such as deep learning and ensemble methods improve predictive performance, they have limited explainability. In this paper, we argue that making software analytics models explainable to software practitioners is as important as achieving accurate predictions. Explainability should therefore be a key measure for evaluating software analytics models. We envision that explainability will be a key driver for developing software analytics models that are useful in practice.

Approach: A bounded literature review of the latest developments in expert knowledge elicitation was undertaken to determine the ’art-of-the-possible’ in respects to uncovering an expert’s cognitive judgements in complex and dynamic environments. Candidate methodologies were systematically and critically reviewed in order to identify the most promising methodologies for uncovering expert situational awareness and metacognitive evaluations in pursuit of actionable threat mitigation strategies in high-risk contexts.

Since these regulations are enacted by law legislators and written in a legal text, these regulations are typically written with ambiguities. However, people have a different interpretation for the legal text for example, software developers faced challenges in identifying and understanding the regulatory requirements that are related to the software development process. Moreover, ambiguous in regulatory requirements play a big role in software compliance with regulatory particularly, when the requirements are legal text.   In this paper, we intend to minimize the ambiguities in EU MDR requirements based on requirement engineering techniques in order to make MDR requirements clear and precise for software developers. In our previous work, we extracted the requirements of MDR that would affect the software development life cycle (SDLC) directly or indirectly. Herein, we will identify the ambiguity types in the extracted requirements of MDR. Moreover, this paper will present a method to minimize the ambiguities in MDR requirements based on requirement engineering techniques (user story and use case diagram).

Using this knowledge it is possible to represent and to make inferences about the semantic content of legal documents. In this paper a methodology for applying NLP techniques to automatically create a legal ontology is proposed. The ontology is defined in the OWL semantic web language and it is used in a logic programming framework, EVOLP+ISCO, to allow users to query the semantic content of the documents. ISCO allows an easy and efficient integration of declarative, object-oriented and constraint-based programming techniques with the capability to create connections with external databases. EVOLP is a dynamic logic programming framework allowing the definition of rules for actions and events. An application of the proposed methodology to the legal information retrieval system of the Portuguese Attorney General's Office is described.","2005","2025-03-26 12:57:06","2025-03-26 12:57:06","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=A%20methodology%20to%20create%20legal%20ontologies%20in%20a%20logic%20programming%20information%20retrieval%20system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper proposes a formal specification language for contracts, called Symboleo, where contracts consist of collections of obligations and powers that define the legal contract’s compliant executions. The formal semantics of Symboleo is based on an extension of an ontology for Law and is described in terms of logical axioms on statecharts that describe the lifetimes of contracts, obligations and powers. Our proposal includes a preliminary evaluation through the specification of a real life-inspired Sale-of-Goods contract, with a prototype execution engine.

Briand; John Dann; John Dann","Automated Recommendation of Templates for Legal Requirements","","","","","","[Context] In legal requirements elicitation, requirements analysts need to extract obligations from legal texts. However, legal texts often express obligations only indirectly, for example, by attributing a right to the counterpart. This phenomenon has already been described in the Requirements Engineering (RE) literature [1]. [Objectives] We investigate the use of requirements templates for the systematic elicitation of legal requirements. Our work is motivated by two observations: (1) The existing literature does not provide a harmonized view on the requirements templates that are useful for legal RE; (2) Despite the promising recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP), automated support for legal RE through the suggestion of requirements templates has not been achieved yet. Our objective is to take steps toward addressing these limitations. [Methods] We review and reconcile the legal requirement templates proposed in RE. Subsequently, we conduct a qualitative study to define NLP rules for template recommendation. [Results and Conclusions] Our contributions consist of (a) a harmonized list of requirements templates pertinent to legal RE, and (b) rules for the automatic recommendation of such templates. We evaluate our rules through a case study on 400 statements from two legal domains. The results indicate a recall and precision of 82,3% and 79,8%, respectively. We show that introducing some limited interaction with the analyst considerably improves accuracy. Specifically, our human-feedback strategy increases recall by 12% and precision by 10,8%, thus yielding an overall recall of 94,3% and overall precision of 90,6%.","2020","2025-03-26 12:57:06","2025-03-26 12:57:06","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Automated%20Recommendation%20of%20Templates%20for%20Legal%20Requirements","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Typically, the process of requirements elicitation begins after a contractual agreement is signed by all participants. Our interactions with the legal compliance team in a large vendor organization reveal that business contracts can help in the identification of high-level requirements relevant to the success of software engineering projects. We posit that requirements engineering as a discipline has an even wider scope than software engineering of which it is traditionally considered to be a sub-discipline. This is because software engineering-specific requirements are but a part of the success story of any large project. The requirements that emerge from contracts are obligatory in nature, whether or not they pertain to core software development. Therefore, it is important that these are extracted and classified for the benefit of software engineers and other stakeholders responsible for a project. We discuss the results of an exploratory study and a range of experiments from the use of regular expressions to Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for automating the extraction and classification of requirements from software engineering contracts. With Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, we obtained a high f-score of greater than eighty four percent for classification of requirements.","2020","2025-03-26 12:57:06","2025-03-26 12:57:06","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/re48521.2020.00026","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Smart contracts are software systems that monitor the execution of contracts to ensure compliance. As a starting point for developing software engineering concepts, tools, and techniques for smart contracts, we have proposed Symboleo, a formal specification language for contracts. The complexity of real-life contracts (e.g., in the construction and transportation industries) requires specification languages to support execution-time operations for contracts, such as subcontracting, assignment, delegation, and substitution. This paper formalizes such concepts by proposing for them a syntax and axiomatic semantics within Symboleo. This formalization makes use of primitive operations that support the transfer or sharing of right, responsibility, and performance among contracting and subcontracting parties. A prototype compliance checking tool for Symboleo has also been created to support monitoring compliance for contracts that include subcontracting aspects. A realistic freight contract specified in Symboleo is provided as an illustrative example for our proposal, and is used for a preliminary evaluation with positive results.KeywordsContractsFormal specification languagesLegal subcontractsSmart contractsSubcontracting","2020","2025-03-26 12:57:06","2025-03-26 12:57:06","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Subcontracting,%20Assignment,%20and%20Substitution%20for%20Legal%20Contracts%20in%20Symboleo","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It builds upon the situated courteous logic programs knowledge representation in RuleML, the emerging standard for Semantic Web XML rules. Here, we newly extend the SweetDeal approach by also incorporating process knowledge descriptions whose ontologies are represented in DAML+OIL (the close predecessor of W3C's OWL, the emerging standard for Semantic Web ontologies), thereby enabling more complex contracts with behavioral provisions, especially for handling exception conditions (e.g., late delivery or non-payment) that might arise during the execution of the contract. This provides a foundation for representing and automating deals about services - in particular, about Web Services, so as to help search, select, and compose them. We give a detailed application scenario of late delivery in manufacturing supply chain management (SCM). In doing so, we draw upon our new formalization of process ontology knowledge from the MIT Process Handbook, a large, previously-existing repository used by practical industrial process designers. Our system is the first to combine emerging Semantic Web standards for knowledge representation of rules (RuleML) with ontologies (DAML+OIL/OWL) with each other, and moreover for a practical e-business application domain, and further to do so with process knowledge.

An Introduction to the Law, Ethics, and HIPAA Rule on Medical Privacy","Georgia State University law review","","","10.1385/1-59259-089-6:3","","After years of Congressional debates and agency rule-making, the HIPAA health care privacy rule has finally become effective. Why did it take so long? Many of the issues which deadlocked Congressional attempts to pass federal privacy legislation reflect deep disagreements over how much individual privacy should be protected. On one hand, patients often believe that no one except their closest health caregivers should be able to see their medical records without their permission. On the other hand, many other people and entities, mostly strangers to the patient, believe they should have access to those records without having to ask permission. They argue that such relatively free access to individual health care information is good for the patient, good for other patients, and good for society - in other words, that too much privacy protection is bad for our individual and collective health. Indeed, society has often tolerated sacrifices in individual medical privacy in order to promote the public good. This article examines the ethical trade-offs that we have made between the benefits of privacy protection and the benefits of sacrificing it in the name of social welfare, such as advances in scientific research, protection of the public health, higher efficiency and better quality in the delivery of health care, and even improved law enforcement. It analyzes how these ethical trade-offs have been reflected in our laws, Congressional debates, and recent HIPAA privacy rule. It also examines several key issues which created the impasse in enacting comprehensive federal legislation, and which continue to be controversial as providers face the task of compliance. The article serves as a guide for legal and health care professionals who would like to be introduced to what the controversy over health care privacy has been all about and how the HIPAA rule has, at least for the time being, resolved some aspects of it.","2000","2025-03-26 12:57:06","2025-03-26 12:57:06","","","","","","","Georgia State University law review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1385/1-59259-089-6:3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I derive the optimal fine for the underlying offense, the optimal fine for misrepresenting one's wealth level, and the optimal audit probability. The optimal fine for misrepresenting wealth equals the fine for the offense divided by the audit probability, and therefore generally exceeds the fine for the offense. The optimal audit probability is positive, increases as the cost of an audit declines, and equals unity if the cost is sufficiently low. If the optimal audit probability is less than unity, there are some individuals who are capable of paying the fine for the offense who misrepresent their wealth levels. Additionally, the optimal fine for the offense results in underdeterrence due to the cost of auditing wealth levels.","2006","2025-03-26 12:57:07","2025-03-26 12:57:07","","","","","","","International Review of Law and Economics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1016/j.irle.2006.11.004","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Automatically extracting this embedded causal knowledge supports not only reasoning about requirements dependencies, but also various automated engineering tasks such as seamless derivation of test cases. However, causality extraction from natural language is still an open research challenge as existing approaches fail to extract causality with reasonable performance. We understand causality extraction from requirements as a two-step problem: First, we need to detect if requirements have causal properties or not. Second, we need to understand and extract their causal relations. At present, though, we lack knowledge about the form and complexity of causality in requirements, which is necessary to develop a suitable approach addressing these two problems. We conduct an exploratory case study with 14,983 sentences from 53 requirements documents originating from 18 different domains and shed light on the form and complexity of causality in requirements. Based on our findings, we develop a tool-supported approach for causality detection (CiRA). This constitutes a first step towards causality extraction from NL requirements. We report on a case study and the resulting tool-supported approach for causality detection in requirements. Our case study corroborates, among other things, that causality is, in fact, a widely used linguistic pattern to describe system behavior, as about a third of the analyzed sentences are causal. We further demonstrate that our tool CiRA achieves a macro-F1 score of 82 % on real word data and that it outperforms related approaches with an average gain of 11.06 % in macro-Recall and 11.43 % in macro-Precision. Finally, we disclose our open data sets as well as our tool to foster the discourse on the automatic detection of causality in the RE community.","2021","2025-03-26 12:57:07","2025-03-26 12:57:07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-73128-1_2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The rising interest in the development of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) shows that blockchain technology has the potential to reform business and society. A DAO is an organization wherein business rules are encoded in smart-contract programs that are executed when specified rules are met. The contractual- and business semantics are sine qua non for drafting a legally-binding smart contract in DAO collaborations. Several smart-contract languages (SCLs) exist, such as SPESC, or Symboleo to specify a legally-binding contract. However, their primary focus is on designing and developing smart contracts with the cooperation of IT- and non-IT users. Therefore, this paper fills a gap in the state of the art by specifying a smart-legal-contract markup language (SLCML) for legal- and business constructs to draft a legally-binding DAO. To achieve the paper objective, we first present a formal SCL ontology to describe the legal- and business semantics of a DAO. Secondly, we translate the SCL ontology into SLCML, for which we present the XML schema definition. We demonstrate and evaluate our SLCML language through the specification of a real life-inspired Sale-of-Goods contract. Finally, the SLCML use-case code is translated into Solidity to demonstrate its feasibility for blockchain platform implementations.","2021","2025-03-26 12:57:07","2025-03-26 12:57:07","","","","","","","IEEE Access","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2021.3081926","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The notion exists in various domains (for example with the representation of preferences in artificial intelligence, or in cognitive psychology). On the other hand, argumentation process is a promising approach for reasoning, based on the construction and the comparison of arguments. It follows five steps: building the arguments, defining the interactions between these arguments, valuating the arguments, selecting the most acceptable arguments and, finally, drawing a conclusion. Using the nomenclature proposed by Dubois and Prade, this article shows on various applications, and with some formal definitions, that bipolarity appears in argumentation (in some cases if not always) and can be used in each step of this process under different forms. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","2008","2025-03-26 12:57:07","2025-03-26 12:57:07","","","","","","","International Journal of Intelligent Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1002/int.20307","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the world of complex systems developed under contract, systems engineering has a well‐articulated, generally accepted, client‐mandated methodology. This is not the case currently in most commercially oriented research and development organizations. Unlike the military/aerospace environment, it is not widely accepted that systems engineering can or will deliver value within commercial enterprises. This said, it is possible that a systems engineering‐like methodology may be routinely employed but not so stated, or is recognized under a different label. This seems likely since complex products continue to be successfully developed and commercialized via the use of methods that are closely related to systems engineering. The purpose of this paper is to establish the groundwork for measuring the effectiveness of the systems engineering methodology, and closely associated analogs, as part of the product development process in a commercial research and development organization. In this paper, we review the literature in systems engineering and related fields to identify measurement issues and methodologies, specific metrics proposed and in use, and case studies and best practices. We also identify gaps in the literature and propose the next steps in a research agenda. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Two recently completed systems engineering empirical studies are used to illustrate specific examples. Finally, suggestions are given on how a professional society might provide additional support for researchers completing empirical research in systems engineering. The overarching goal of this paper is to describe how the increased use of empirical methods can be used to enrich the quality of research results which will in turn enhance the position of systems engineering as a widely recognized academic field.

While systems vary from organization to organization, regulations apply across organizations. We propose the use of Behavior-Driven-Development (BDD) scenarios as the basis of an automated compliance test suite for standards such as regulation and interoperability. Such test suites could become a shared asset for use by all systems subject to these regulations and standards. Each system, then, need only create their own system-specific test driver code to automate their compliance checks. The goal of this research is to enable organizations to compare their systems to regulation in a repeatable and traceable way through the use of BDD. To evaluate our proposal, we developed an abbreviated HIPAA test suite and applied it to three open-source electronic health record systems. The scenarios covered all security behavior defined by the selected regulation. The system-specific test driver code covered all security behavior defined in the scenarios, and identified where the tested system lacked such behavior.","///","2025-03-26 12:57:07","2025-03-26 12:57:07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/sehc.2013.6602477","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Popa; Daniel Popa; Georg Post; Georg Post","Semantic networking: Flow-based, traffic-aware, and self-managed networking","Bell Labs Technical Journal","","","10.1002/bltj.20371","","In order to overcome current Internet limitations on overall network scalability and complexity, we introduce a new paradigm of semantic networking for the networks of the future, which brings together flow-based networking, traffic awareness, and self-management concepts to deliver plug-and-play networks. The natural traffic granularity is the flow between packet and circuit and between connection-less and connection-oriented modes. Using flow aggregation capabilities, we simplify traffic processing in the nodes through elastic fluid switching, and simplify traffic control through flow admission control, policing, and implicit quality of service (QoS) routing. By leveraging deep packet inspection and behavioral traffic analysis, network elements can autonomously and efficiently process the traffic flows they transport through real-time awareness gained via semantic analysis. The global consistency of node decisions within the whole network is ensured by self-management, applying the concepts of “knowledge plane” and “network mining.”","///","2025-03-26 12:57:07","2025-03-26 12:57:07","","","","","","","Bell Labs Technical Journal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1002/bltj.20371","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Pollock","Defeasible Reasoning","Cognitive Science","","","10.1207/s15516709cog1104_4","","What philosophers call defeasible reasoning is roughly the same as nonmonotonic reasoning in AI. Some brief remarks are made about the nature of reasoning and the relationship between work in epistemology, AI, and cognitive psychology. This is followed by a general description of human rational architecture. This description has the consequence that defeasible reasoning has a more complicated structure than has generally been recognized in AI. We define a proposition to be warranted if it would be believed by an ideal reasoner. A general theory of warrant, based on defeasible reasons, is developed. This theory is then used as a guide in the construction of a theory of defeasible reasoning, and a computer program implementing that theory. The theory constructed deals with only a subset of defeasible reasoning, but it is an important subset.","///","2025-03-26 12:57:07","2025-03-26 12:57:07","","","","","","","Cognitive Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1207/s15516709cog1104_4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
