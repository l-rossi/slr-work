	abstract = {Every year, governments introduce new or revised regulations that are imposing new types of requirements on software development. Analyzing and modeling these legal requirements is time consuming, challenging and cumbersome for software and requirements engineers. Having regulation models can help understand regulations and converge toward better compliance levels for software and systems. This paper introduces a systematic method to extract legal requirements from regulations by mapping the latter to the Legal Profile for Goal-oriented Requirements Language (GRL) (Legal GRL). This profile provides a conceptual meta-model for the anatomy of regulations and maps its elements to standard GRL with specialized annotations and links, with analysis techniques that exploit this additional information. The paper also illustrates examples of Legal GRL models for The Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations. Existing tool support (jUCMNav) is also extended to support Legal GRL modeling.},

We argue that the law requires sometimes propagating the ambiguity to other norms and sometimes confining it to some norms only. We explore this issue and model different reasoning patterns. The problem is addressed in a new variant of Defeasible Deontic Logic. The contribution of this paper is threefold: (a) we extend the treatment of ambiguity blocking and propagation to Defeasible Deontic Logic; (b) we discuss reasoning patterns in the law, especially in criminal law, where we need to deal with both ambiguity blocking and ambiguity propagation in the same legal system and logic; (c) we devise an annotated variant of Defeasible Deontic Logic where we distinguish literals that must be obtained through an ambiguity-blocking mechanism from those that are derived using an ambiguity-propagating mechanism.},

	abstract = {The healthcare ecosystem is highly complex. It is composed of multiple stakeholders with intersecting interests. The healthcare regulations such as Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, much like the systems they protect, are complex and often difficult to interpret. Regulations contain obligations that must be fulfilled by healthcare systems that form the backbone of modern healthcare. In this paper, we present a model for extracting and deconstructing obligations. The Obligation Model allows for capturing the essence of obligations in terms of their attributes such as Responsible entity, Trigger, Action, Deadline and Reference. We augment the extracted obligations with auxiliary information present in regulation documents and provide an ownership based rendering of the deconstructed obligation in an HTML format. This helps in establishing an explicit ownership of obligations and contributes towards enhancing accountability of stakeholders towards fulfilling the obligations. The rendering will be useful for building compliant healthcare systems by making the legal text more comprehensible for system designers.},

We treat duties as agents' obligations towards others to perform actions. We think that powers are agents' legal abilities, conferred by law, to change legal positions between agents. How to exercise powers is also specified by law. Many factors, including the exercise of powers, fulfillment of duties, violation of duties, and factual changes in the world, can change duties. The ontic level of the logic is a multi-agent dynamic logic, where agents have abilities to change atomic facts. At its normative level, agents have duties towards others to change atomic facts, and have powers to change duties by changing atomic facts. When agents behave, the ontic and normative aspects of the world change accordingly. The implications of the formalization are studied extensively.},

	abstract = {When literal interpretation of statutes leads to counterintuitive consequences, judges, especially in high courts, may identify counterintuitive consequences and revise interpretation of statutes. Researchers have studied revisions for computational legal representation. Generally, studies on revision usually consider minimal revision to reflect limitation of judges' legislative power. However, those studies tend to minimize the number of operations used for changing rules rather than minimize the changes of semantics (the set of conclusions obtained from the program), which vary among cases. In this paper, we consider minimizing the changes of semantics of a rule-base written in a normal logic program. We consider that each possible fact-base (the representation of a case) has its corresponding semantics and corresponding dominant rule-base, which is a set of Horn clauses obtained from the subset of rule-base that is specific to the considered fact-base. Hence, we present a new sub type of semantics-based minimal revision called a dominant-based minimal revision. Furthermore, we present one guidance to obtain one dominant-based minimal revision by using legal debugging and Closed World Specification. We also compare the dominant-based minimal revision with the syntax-based minimal revision in Theory Distance Metric. As the syntax-based minimal revision minimizes the number of operations used for changing rules, the comparison shows that the syntax-based minimal revision may cause extra semantics changes compared to the dominant-based minimal revision, especially when the rule-base contains multiple rules for the same consequence. We discuss that such extra semantics changes can be considered as unintentional changes caused by the syntax-based minimal revision. Hence, legal reasoning systems can check with the user such extra semantics changes to confirm the user intention of changes.},

Formal compliance checking techniques in contrast attempt to provide ways for rigorous modeling and analysis of regulatory compliance but miss out on holistic GRC perspective due to missing integration between diverse set of (semi-) formal models. We show that streamlining regulatory compliance using multiple purposive models of various aspects of regulations, it is possible to leverage both the rigor of formal techniques and the holistic enterprise GRC perspective. Our contributions are twofold. First, we present a model-driven architecture based on a conceptual model of integrated GRC that is capable of addressing key challenges of regulatory compliance. Second, using Know Your Customer regulations in Indian context as a case study, we demonstrate the utility of this architecture. Initial results with KYC regulations are promising and point to further work in model-driven regulatory compliance.},

The ANGELIC (ADF for kNowledGe Encapsulation of Legal Information for Cases) methodology was originally developed to exploit then recent developments in knowledge representation techniques that lend themselves well to capturing factor-based reasoning about legal cases. The methodology is situated firmly within the tradition of research in AI and Law that aims to build systems that are knowledge rich in terms of the domain expertise that is emulated within the systems. When the methodology was first introduced, it was demonstrated on academic examples, but it was subsequently used in and evaluated on a variety of real world domains for external clients. This set of evaluation exercises yielded a variety of learning points as the methodology was applied to different legal domains with their own particular features. These learning points, and the extensions to the methodology that follow from them, urge a consolidation exercise to provide an updated version of the methodology that reflects how it has matured over time. This paper represents a milestone in the development of the methodology in that it presents the ANGELIC II Domain Model, along with a description of its constituent parts, and demonstrates its application through a case study in a key evaluation domain.},

Second, we report the semantic types of sentence role we use to extract and represent the fact-finding reasoning found in adjudicatory decisions, with the goal of identifying successful and unsuccessful patterns of evidentiary argument. For each type system, we provide explanations and examples. Thus, we hope to stimulate a shared effort to create diverse datasets in law, to empirically evolve optimal sets of semantic types for argument mining, and to refine protocols for accurately applying those types to texts.},

The SIROCCO (\&lt;u\&gt;S\&lt;/u\&gt;ystem for \&lt;u\&gt;I\&lt;/u\&gt;ntelligent \&lt;u\&gt;R\&lt;/u\&gt;etrieval of \&lt;u\&gt;O\&lt;/u\&gt;perationalized \&lt;u\&gt;C\&lt;/u\&gt;ases and \&lt;u\&gt;CO\&lt;/u\&gt;des) program employed a representation for the temporal ordering of events in ethics cases in a way that informed determinations of whether and how ethical norms were violated and if the problem and other cases were normatively analogous at a deeper level. At the same time, the program supported ordinary case enterers in translating the facts of textually described cases into a machine-processable representation. This paper presents these previously unpublished aspects of the work including a report of an empirical evaluation of the contribution of the temporal representation to the program's success in retrieving relevant norms and cases. Although the results were negative, a consideration of the reasons why is illuminating. While SIROCCO dealt with engineering ethics cases, it is clear that similar temporal considerations apply in legal cases and that the approach is likely to be useful in legal narrative representations.},

	abstract = {Collaboration across institutional boundaries is widespread and increasing today. It depends on federations sharing data that often have governance rules or external regulations restricting their use. However, the handling of data governance rules (aka. data-use policies) remains manual, time-consuming and error-prone, limiting the rate at which collaborations can form and respond to challenges and opportunities, inhibiting citizen science and reducing data providers' trust in compliance. Using an automated system to facilitate compliance handling reduces substantially the time needed for such non-mission work, thereby accelerating collaboration and improving productivity. We present a framework, Dr.Aid, that helps individuals, organisations and federations comply with data rules, using automation to track which rules are applicable as data is passed between processes and as derived data is generated. It encodes data-governance rules using a formal language and performs reasoning on multi-input-multi-output data-flow graphs in decentralised contexts. We test its power and utility by working with users performing cyclone tracking and earthquake modelling to support mitigation and emergency response. We query standard provenance traces to detach Dr.Aid from details of the tools and systems they are using, as these inevitably vary across members of a federation and through time. We evaluate the model in three aspects by encoding real-life data-use policies from diverse fields, showing its capability for real-world usage and its advantages compared with traditional frameworks. We argue that this approach will lead to more agile, more productive and more trustworthy collaborations and show that the approach can be adopted incrementally. This, in-turn, will allow more appropriate data policies to emerge opening up new forms of collaboration.},

Hence, the compliance of regulatory requirement from these policies and regulations become an important accountability in e-Government project development where the concepts of regulatory requirements compliance is still scattered in the e-Government domain. This paper presents an ontology framework that describes the formal and explicit specification of the concepts of regulatory requirements compliance and their relations in e-Government system development. The ontology engineering technique 101 and Systematic Literature Review (SLR) were used in the process of developing the ontology framework of e-Government regulatory requirements compliance (eGovRRC). The e-Government system analyst can use this framework as a reference model to understand and conceptualize the interlinked set of clearly defined concepts of regulatory requirements compliance in e-Government system development projects.},

Legal story schemes steer what needs to be proven, but are also selected on the basis of what can be proven. They provide a coherent, holistic legal perspective on a criminal case that steers investigation and decision making. We present an extension of our previously proposed hybrid theory of reasoning with evidence, by making the connection with reasoning towards legal consequences. We discuss the phenomenon of legal shifts that shows that the step from evidence to (proven) facts cannot be isolated from the step from proven facts to legal consequences. We show how legal shifts can be modelled in terms of legal story schemes. Our model is illustrated by a discussion of the Dutch Wamel murder case.},

A regulatory repository is developed based on an XML format, and important features, such as concepts and measurements, are extracted using handcrafted rules and a text mining tool. Our framework provides compliance assistance using a reasoning tool based on First Order Predicate Calculus logic, where users are alerted of detected conflicts or otherwise compliance with the regulation. A relatedness analysis is performed by comparing the extracted features as well as structural and referential information from regulations. Examples of an electronic-rulemaking scenario and a compliance checking procedure are shown to demonstrate current capabilities of the prototype system.},

	abstract = {Medical device regulators such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) aim to make sure that medical devices are reasonably safe before entering the market. To expedite the approval process and make it more uniform and rigorous, regulators are considering the development of reference models that encapsulate safety requirements against which software incorporated in to medical devices must be verified. Safety, insofar as it relates to interactive systems and its regulation, is generally a neglected topic, particularly in the context of medical systems. An example is presented here that illustrates how the interactive behaviour of a commercial Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) infusion pump can be verified against a reference model. Infusion pumps are medical devices used in healthcare to deliver drugs to patients, and PCA pumps are particular infusion pump devices that are often used to provide pain relief to patients on demand. The reference model encapsulates the Generic PCA safety requirements provided by the FDA, and the verification is performed using a refinement approach. The contribution of this work is that it demonstrates a concise and semantically unambiguous approach to representing what a regulator's requirements for a particular interactive device might be, in this case focusing on user-interface requirements. It provides an inspectable and repeatable process for demonstrating that the requirements are satisfied. It has the potential to replace the considerable documentation produced at the moment by a succinct document that can be subjected to careful and systematic analysis.},

	abstract = {Although cloud services allow organizations to transfer the planning and setup to the service provider and thus reduce costs through reuse, these services raise new questions regarding the privacy and security of personal information stored in and transferred across systems in the cloud. Prior to cloud services, personal information was commonly stored within the owning or licensing company's locality where the company maintained its facilities. Cloud services, however, move data to remote, potentially unknown, locations maintained by third parties. The responsibility for data protection and integrity no longer remains exclusively with its owner or licensee, but with these third parties. Thus, both parties must identify and manage the many regulatory requirements that govern their services and products in this multi-jurisdictional environment. To simplify this problem, we are developing methods to extract and codify regulatory requirements from government laws. We apply previously validated metrics to measure gaps and overlaps between the codified regulations. Our findings include a semi-formalization of the legal landscape using operational constructs for high- and low-watermark practices, which correspond to high- and low standards of care, respectively. Business analysts and system developers can use these watermarks to reason about compliance trade-offs based on perceived businesses costs and risks. We discovered and validated these constructs using seven U.S. state data breach notification laws that govern transactions of financial and health information of residents of these seven states.},

	abstract = {The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires data controllers to implement end-to-end compliance. Controllers must therefore ensure that the terms agreed with the data subject and their own obligations under GDPR are respected in the data flows from data subject to controllers, processors and sub processors (i.e. data supply chain). This paper seeks to contribute to bridge both ends of compliance checking through a two-pronged study. First, we conceptualize a framework to implement a document-centric approach to compliance checking in the data supply chain. Second, we develop specific methods to automate compliance checking of privacy policies. We test a two-modules system, where the first module relies on NLP to extract data practices from privacy policies. The second module encodes GDPR rules to check the presence of mandatory information. The results show that the text-to-text approach outperforms local classifiers and enables the extraction of both coarse-grained and fine-grained information with only one model. We implement full evaluation of our system on a dataset of 30 privacy policies annotated by legal experts. We conclude that this approach could be generalized to other documents in the data supply as a means to improve end-to-end compliance.},

The importance of regulatory compliance for software systems has been growing, as regulations are increasingly impacting both the functional and nonfunctional requirements of legacy and new systems. HIPAA and SOX are recent examples of laws with broad impact on software systems, as attested by the billions of dollars spent in the US alone on compliance. In this paper we propose a framework for establishing regulatory compliance for a given set of software requirements. The framework assumes as inputs models of the requirements (expressed in i*) and the regulations (expressed in Nòmos). In addition, we adopt and integrate with i* and Nòmos a modeling technique for capturing arguments and establishing their acceptability. Given these, the framework proposes a systematic process for revising the requirements, and arguing through a discussion among stakeholders that the revisions make the requirements compliant. Our proposed framework is illustrated through a case study involving fragments of the HIPAA regulation.},

	abstract = {In many commonsense contexts only incoherent and conflicting information is available. In such contexts reasonable conclusions must be derived from inconsistent sets of premises. This is especially the case in legal reasoning: legal norms can be issued by different authorities, in different times, to reach incompatible socio-political objectives, and the meaning of those norms can be semantically indeterminate.Logic deduction alone is insufficient to derive justified conclusions out of inconsistent legal premises, since in the most popular logical systems (such as classical or intuitionistic logic) everything can be deduced from any contradiction. Nevertheless, much research now underway shows that formal methods can be developed for reasoning with conflicting information. The possibility of obtaining justified conclusions from an inconsistent set of premises increases when an ordering is defined over that set, since the ordering of the premises can be translated into an ordering of the competing arguments. This fact is particularly relevant for legal reasoning, since lawyers effectively solve normative conflicts by using ordering relations.In the following page, a model for reasoning with ordered defaults, interpreted as unidirectional inference rules, is proposed: a language for representing (possibly) contradictory rules is introduced, a notion of argument is defined, and types of arguments are distinguished. A simple interpreter in Prolog able to develop those arguments is also illustrated. Finally, the significance of the proposed model (and, more generally, of the acceptance of inconsistency) for the formal analysis of legal systems is discussed.},

The lawyer's understanding process can be viewed as an abductive reasoning process, since the lawyer can introduce implicit legal requirements which have not appeared in legal texts.

	abstract = {Organizations collect personal information from individuals to carry out their business functions. Federal privacy regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), mandate how this collected information can be shared by the organizations. It is thus incumbent upon the organizations to have means to check compliance with the applicable regulations. Prior work by Barth et. al. introduces two notions of compliance, weak compliance (WC) and strong compliance (SC). WC ensures that present requirements of the policy can be met whereas SC also ensures obligations can be met. An action is compliant with a privacy policy if it is both weakly and strongly compliant. However, their definitions of compliance are restricted to only propositional linear temporal logic (pLTL), which cannot feasibly specify HIPAA. To this end, we present a policy specification language based on a restricted subset of first order temporal logic (FOTL) which can capture the privacy requirements of HIPAA. We then formally specify WC and SC for policies of our form. We prove that checking WC is feasible whereas checking SC is undecidable. We then formally specify the property WC entails SC, denoted by Δ, which requires that each weakly compliant action is also strongly compliant. To check whether an action is compliant with such a policy, it is sufficient to only check whether the action is weakly compliant with that policy. We also prove that when a policy ℘ has the Δ-property, the present requirements of the policy reduce to the safety requirements imposed by ℘. We then develop a sound, semi-automated technique for checking whether practical policies have the Δ-property. We finally use HIPAA as a case study to demonstrate the efficacy of our policy analysis technique.},

Because we cannot decide an appropriate case structure in advance, a framework for CBR should be able to improve a case structure dynamically, collecting and analyzing cases. Here is discussed a new framework for knowledge acquisition using CBR and model inference. Model Inference tries to obtain new descriptors(predicates) with interaction of a domain expert, regarding the predicate as the slots that compose a case structure, with an eye to the function of theoretical term generation. The framework has two features: (1) CBR obtains a more suitable group of slots (a case structure) incrementally through cooperation with model inference, and (2) model inference with theoretical term capability discovers the rules which deal with a given task better. Furthermore, we evaluate the feasibility of the framework by implementing it to deal with law interpretation and certify two features with the framework.},

	abstract = {Analogy has many important functions in the domain of law. Since the number of legal rules is restricted and their content is often incomplete, it is necessary at times for a lawyer to opt for an analogical application of a legal rule to a given case in order to decide the case properly. He may apply the rule, though it may not have originally been deemed related to such an event, on the basis of some similarity between the event of the case and the requirement of the relevant legal rule. This type of reasoning is called legal analogy. This paper analyzes an actual case of legal analogy in the field of Japanese civil law in order to clarify the reasoning methods used in analogy, as well as knowledge to justify the analogy. Finally it will be shown how the knowledge is utilized in a symbolic reasoning system both in terms of inverse and standard resolution.},

This relative suitability is judged by matching the features of the selected best case and best rule against the new case. Standard methods of numerical taxonomy are used to determine which of the matches is best, and therefore whether a new case is better solved by calling on rules that express the usual legal knowledge in the area or by referring to a past case that has a interpretation of an ambiguous situation which rules fail to underpin.},

The semantic legal policies in compliance with the laws are enforced automatically at the super-peer to enable LaaS. This allows CSPs to deploy their cloud resources and services without worrying about law violations. Afterward, users could query data from the law-aware super-peer within a super-peer domain. Each query is also compliant with the laws. Policies are shown as a combination of OWL-DL ontologies and stratified Datalog rules with negation for a policy's exceptions handling through defeasible (or non-monotonic) reasoning.

	abstract = {There have been several knowledge-based systems for statutory building regulations during the last decade, such as Fenves et al's systems using the SASE model, Stone and Wilcox's system using a rule-based approach, and Waard's system using Cornick et al;'s model-based approach. However, they take into account only one side of building regulations, considering them only in the context of design systems and ignoring the existence of case histories. Building regulations are also part of a legal system and have characteristics of law. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge-Intensive Case-based reasoning System which can be used for the retrieval and maintenance of building regulations and case histories. First, we propose a unified knowledge representation scheme for both statutory building regulations and case histories. Second, we describe the retrieval of regulations information, which uses the notion of implied similarity as well as structural mapping. Finally, we describe knowledge acquisition from case histories, which is guided by knowledge gained from statutory regulations and case histories.},

	abstract = {Legal argument is typically backed by two kinds of sources: cases and rules. In much AI \&amp; Law research, the formalization of arguments, rules and cases has been investigated. In this paper, the tight formal connections between the three are developed further, in an attempt to show that cases can provide the logical basis for establishing which rules and arguments hold in a domain. We use the recently proposed formalism of case models, that has been applied previously to evidential reasoning and ethical systems design. In the present paper, we discuss with respect to case-based modeling how the analogy and distinction between cases can be modeled, and how arguments can be grounded in cases. With respect to rule-based modeling, we discuss conditionality, generality and chaining. With respect to argument-based modeling, we discuss rebutting, undercutting and undermining attack. We evaluate the approach by developing a case model of the rule-based arguments and attacks in Dutch tort law. In this way, we illustrate how statutory, rule-based law from the civil law tradition can be formalized in terms of cases.},

Typically, many domain areas face the problem that stakeholders maintain databases of their business core information and they have to take decisions or create reports according to guidelines, policies or regulations. To address this issue we propose the integration of databases, in particular relational databases, with a logic reasoner and rule engine. We argue that defeasible logic is an appropriate formalism to model rules, in particular when the rules are meant to model regulations. The resulting RuleOMS provides an efficient and flexible solution to the problem at hand using defeasible inference. A case study of an online child care management system is used to illustrate the proposed architecture.},

This builds on previous work which has first used abstract Argumentation Frameworks, and then Value based Argumentation Frameworks for this purpose.Extended Argumentation Frameworks augment Argumentation Frameworks to not only allow arguments to be attacked, but also attacks to be attacked. This allows argumentation based reasoning about information normally assumed to be metalevel to the object level domain of argumentation, including argumentation over preferences, values and the audience based ranking of values promoted by arguments. The Extended Argumentation Frameworks can then be rewritten as standard Argumentation Frameworks, so that cases, and values and their rankings relevant to the cases, can be reasoned about using standard dialogue games for Argumentation Frameworks. In this way precedents can be represented as collections of arguments and dialogues using these arguments. Now, when confronted with a new case, these dialogues may be used to identify ways of deploying the arguments in the new case so as to reach a favourable position.},

Especially when an access from different countries is required different legislations have to be taken into account. In this paper, we address the problem of a law-compliant access in international financial environments. We present an extension to context-aware access control systems so that they incorporate legal constraints. To this end, we introduce different facets of context information, their interrelations, and describe their necessity for a law-aware access control. Finally, by using an international banking application scenario, we demonstrate how a system that follows our approach can decide about access.},

This paper clarifies the logical structure of a legal system to decide the above two dimension in unified reasoning in terms of the validity of legal sentences. It provides a logical model of reasoning the validity of legal sentences for a unified legal reasoning system, in which legal relations according to the time progress of legal problem-events are decided and at the same time the applicability of relevant legal rules to decide them is decided. We demonstrate the legitimacy and efficiency of this model by applying it to concrete examples and showing how legal meta-sentences and legal meta-inference work in this model.},

This is in contrast to approaches which take as a starting point a set of decided cases, with no account taken of the order in which they were decided. The model of legal reasoning we follow is based on Levi's account which shows how decided cases often need to be reinterpreted in the light of subsequent decisions, so that features of cases wax and wane in importance. Our aim is to reproduce the arguments that could have been used in a given case, rather than to apply a retrospective understanding of the law to them. A second novel feature is that we use a general purpose ontology to describe the cases, rather than one developed specifically to model the pertinent cases. The paper describes a prototype implementation, and uses an example to illustrate how our approach works. After this case by case description we make some remarks on the insights gained, and draw some conclusions.},

According to this framework, each predicate defined in a rule base is characterized by its defining reasoning mode, scope, and exporting rule base list. Each predicate used in a rule base is characterized by its requesting reasoning mode and importing rule base list. For legal MWeb modular rule bases S, the MWebAS and MWebWFS semantics of each rule base s ∈ S with respect to S are defined model-theoretically. These semantics extend the answer set semantics (AS) and the well-founded semantics with explicit negation (WFSX) on ELPs, respectively, keeping all of their semantical and computational characteristics. Our framework supports: (1) local semantics and different points of view, (2) local closed-world and open-world assumptions, (3) scoped negation-as-failure, (4) restricted propagation of local inconsistencies, and (5) monotonicity of reasoning, for fully shared predicates.},

We believe that reasoning with cases involves all of theory construction, use and evaluation, and that awareness of the theory which provides a context for case based arguments is essential to understanding such arguments. Moreover, our account of these theories includes a systematic link between factors and values, which we believe is necessary to explain why some arguments prove to be more persuasive than others. We begin by formalising the various elements that the theories contain, and then provide a set of theory constructors which allow theories to built up from the background of decided cases. We show how such theories can be used to explain decisions on particular cases. We discuss how theories can be compared and evaluated. We then show how the argument moves of HYPO and CATO can be understood in terms of our framework. We conclude with a brief discussion of an implementation of the framework, and a summary of the major features of our approach.},

Aiming at the problem of heterogeneous fuzzy rule interchange in the Semantic Web, which is based on the proposed Semantic Web Criminal Law Rule Language (CLRL), and based on the rules and norms of XML. We construct the rule mapping between the CLRL and Legal Knowledge Interchange Format (LKIF), and propose a heterogeneous fuzzy criminal law rules interchange architecture (CRIAXS), which supports the bidirectional rule interchange between legal rules. We also analyze the problem of information loss caused by the different language expression ability in the process of legal knowledge interchange, and put forward to the solution. Based on the above description, the prototype system CRIAXS which is based on the JavaScript language has been achieved on the HBuilder platform. We also verify the correctness and stability of the system through multiple conversion examples. The results show that the architecture and the implemented system which laysa solid foundation for the rule-based reasoning, has a good solution to the communication problem between heterogeneous systems, and it has a wide range of application prospects.},

In this paper we extend our work on IT-enforceable policies, submitted to the International Journal of Medical Informatics. The submitted work involved a detailed analysis of HIPPA privacy rules to extract object related conditions needed to make a disclosure decision. In this paper we extend this work to propose machine enforceable policies that embody HIPAA privacy disclosure rules and a health care entity access control rules. We also propose a comprehensive access/privacy control architecture that enforces the proposed polices. The architectural model is designed to allow for a dynamic configuration of policies without reconfiguring the architecture responsible for enforcement. Both the proposed policies and the architecture allow for multiple stakeholders to adjust the privacy preferences to manage the disclosure of data by adjusting the designated parameters in their respective policies. The objective of this study is to provide a comprehensive model for privacy protection, access and logging of PHI, that is HIPAA compliant.},
