"B6IANLN2","journalArticle","2004","Helen Nissenbaum; Helen Nissenbaum","Privacy as contextual integrity","Washington Law Review","","","","","The practices of public surveillance, which include the monitoring of individuals in public through a variety of media (e.g., video, data, online), are among the least understood and controversial challenges to privacy in an age of information technologies. The fragmentary nature of privacy policy in the United States reflects not only the oppositional pulls of diverse vested interests, but also the ambivalence of unsettled intuitions on mundane phenomena such as shopper cards, closed-circuit television, and biometrics. This Article, which extends earlier work on the problem of privacy in public, explains why some of the prominent theoretical approaches to privacy, which were developed over time to meet traditional privacy challenges, yield unsatisfactory conclusions in the case of public surveillance. It posits a new construct, “contextual integrity,” as an alternative benchmark for privacy, to capture the nature of challenges posed by information technologies. Contextual integrity ties adequate protection for privacy to norms of specific contexts, demanding that information gathering and dissemination be appropriate to that context and obey the governing norms of distribution within it. Building on the idea of “spheres of justice,” developed by political philosopher Michael Walzer, this Article argues that public surveillance violates a right to privacy because it violates contextual integrity; as such, it constitutes injustice and even tyranny.","2004","2025-04-16 12:38:23","2025-04-16 12:38:23","","","","","","","Washington Law Review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Privacy%20as%20contextual%20integrity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Balancing compliance obligations with business objectives remains however a difficult challenge. We believe goal-oriented compliance management using Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure the compliance level of organizations is an area that can be further developed to tackle this challenge. Goaloriented compliance management concepts have been explored before. However, there is little research on how to measure and improve the compliance level of organizations using KPIs while considering the impact of candidate adjustments on business goals.

"YMXCW8D7","journalArticle","1995","John Mylopoulos; John Mylopoulos; Eric Yu; Eric Yu","Modelling strategic relationships for process reengineering","","","","","","Existing models for describing a process (such as a business process or a software development process) tend to focus on the ""what"" or the ""how"" of the process. For example, a health insurance claim process would typically be described in terms of a number of steps for assessing and approving a claim. In trying to improve or redesign a process, however, one also needs to have an understanding of the ""why""--for example, why do physicians submit treatment plans to insurance companies before giving treatment? and why do claims managers seek medical opinions when assessing treatment plans? An understanding of the motivations and interests of process participants is often crucial to the successful redesign of processes. This thesis proposes a modelling framework i* (pronounced i-star) consisting of two modelling components. The Strategic Dependency (SD) model describes a process in terms of intentional dependency relationships among agents. Agents depended on each other for goals to be achieved, tasks to be performed, and resources to be furnished. Agents are intentional in that they have desires and wants, and strategic in that they are concerned about opportunities and vulnerabilities. The Strategic Rationale (SR) model describes the issues and concerns that agents have about existing processes and proposed alternatives, and how they might be addressed, in terms of a network of means-ends relationships. An agent's routines for carrying out a process can be analyzed for their ability, workability, viability and believability. Means-ends rules are used to suggest methods for addressing issues, related issues to be raised, and assumptions to be challenged. The models are represented in the conceptual modelling language Telos. The modelling concepts are axiomatically characterized. The utility of the framework is illustrated each of four application areas: requirements engineering, business process reengineering, organizational impacts analysis, and software process modelling. Advantage of i* over existing modelling techniques in each of these areas are described.","1995","2025-04-16 12:38:26","2025-04-16 12:38:26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Modelling%20strategic%20relationships%20for%20process%20reengineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"6C56AYUA","journalArticle","2005","Erik Kamsties; Erik Kamsties; E. Kamsties","Taming Ambiguity in Natural Language Requirements","","","","","","One of the main tasks of requirements engineering (RE) is the creation of a requirements document that precisely, consistently, and completely describes the functional and non-functional properties of the system to be built. At some point during the RE process, the requirements are written down using a natural language or a requirements specification language. On one hand, natural language is flexible, universal, and wide-spread. On the other hand, natural language requirements are recognized widely as being incomplete, inconsistent, and inherently ambiguous. Semi-formal and formal requirements specification techniques, such as UML [13] or SCR [5], have been proposed to overcome these deficiencies. Completeness and consistency of these specifications can be tackled to some degree mechanically by tools. However, as a recent study shows, ambiguity rarely surfaces during the development of a requirements model [10]. Thus, since a requirements specification technique enforces precision, the resulting requirements model becomes unambiguously wrong. In this paper, we show how to detect ambiguities in natural language requirements using a checklist. We distinguish between linguistic and RE-specific ambiguities. Linguistic ambiguities are those ambiguities that are usually discussed in RE textbooks such as ambiguous pronoun references. RE-specific ambiguities occur with respect to the RE context, which includes the application domain and the system domain. For example, the requirement (1) If the bank customer maintains a minimum balance in his or her checking account, there is no monthly service charge. is ambiguous not because of its linguistic representation, but because of the operational environment and application domain. In the requirements documents that we have investigated, RE-specific ambiguities account for the majority of ambiguities, while pure linguistic ambiguities played a less significant role. In this paper, we present also an approach that allows identifying types of RE-specific ambiguity from a metamodel, e.g., of a requirements specification technique. Based on the identified types of ambiguity, we have developed an improved inspection technique for natural language requirements on the basis of checklists and scenario-based reading.","2005","2025-04-16 12:38:27","2025-04-16 12:38:27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Taming%20Ambiguity%20in%20Natural%20Language%20Requirements","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Allen","SYMBOLIC LOGIC: A RAZOR-EDGED TOOL FOR DRAFTING AND INTERPRETING LEGAL DOCUMENTS","Yale Law Journal","","","10.2307/794073","","A large amount of the litigation based on written instruments?whether statute, contract, will, conveyance or regulation?can be traced to the draftsman's failure to convey his meaning clearly. Frequently, of course, certain items may purposely be left ambiguous, but often the question in issue is due to an inadvertent ambiguity that could have been avoided had the draftsman clearly expressed what he intended to say. In this Article it is suggested that a new approach to drafting, using certain elementary notions of symbolic logic, can go a long way towards eliminating such inadvertent ambiguity. This new approach makes available to draftsmen a technique that achieves some of the clarity, precision and efficiency of analysis that symbolic logic provides. In addition, it can be a valuable aid in moving towards a more comprehensive and systematic method of interpretation,1 as well as drafting. This approach is a compromise between expression in ordinary prose and expression in the mathematical notation of symbolic logic?enough like ordi? nary prose to be understood easily by any careful reader, enough like sym? bolic logic to achieve some of its important advantages. It represents an effort to adapt some of the techniques of symbolic logic to make more systematic what is now best described as the ""art"" of drafting. The first section will explain six elementary logical connectives: implication, conjunction, coimplication, exclusive disjunction, inclusive disjunction and negation. In order to simplify this exposition, trivial examples will be used for purposes of illustration. In the second section the proposed system will be applied to actual legal problems of drafting, interpretation, simplification and comparison.

It may compete with other objectives such as functionality, usability, and performance. Too often, security mechanisms such as firewalls, access control, or encryption are adopted without explicit recognition of competing design objectives and their origins in stakeholders' interests. Recently, there is increasing acknowledgement that security is ultimately about trade-offs. One can only aim for ''good enough'' security, given the competing demands from many parties. This paper investigates the criteria for a conceptual modeling technique for making security trade-offs. We examine how conceptual modeling can provide explicit and systematic support for modeling and analyzing security trade-offs. We examine several existing approaches for dealing with trade-offs and security trade-offs in particular. From analyzing the limitations of existing methods, we propose an extension to the i^* Framework for security trade-off analysis, taking advantage of its multi-agent and goal orientation.

In this paper we present RiSD, a method for building Strategic Dependency (SD) models in the i* notation. RiSD is defined in a prescriptive way to reduce uncertainness when constructing the model. RiSD tackles three fundamental issues: (1) it tends to reduce the average size of the resulting models; (2) it defines some traceability relationships among model elements; (3) it provides some lexical and syntactical conventions. As a result, we may say that RiSD supports the construction process of goal- and agent-oriented models whilst increasing their understanding.","2007","2025-04-16 12:38:31","2025-04-16 12:38:31","","","","","","","International Journal of Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1142/s0218194007003148","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Advance notice relies on having access to the right information at the right time. This information includes trace digital evidence, distributed across public and private networks that are governed by various privacy policies, inter-agency agreements, federal and state laws and international treaties. To enable rapid and assured information sharing that protects privacy, the US government needs a means to balance privacy with the need to share. In this paper, we review US laws and policies governing government surveillance and describe key elements for a privacy management framework that seeks to enable government investigations while protecting privacy in a systematic way. The framework aligns existing Federal investigative guidelines for attributing a cyberattack with concerns for automated decision making that arise from the Fourth Amendment “reasonable expectation of privacy” and several fair information practice principles. We discuss technical challenges for those seeking to implement this framework.","2011","2025-04-16 12:38:32","2025-04-16 12:38:32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/ths.2011.6107840","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Particularly when these are written, as they usually are, in natural language, ambiguity—by any definition—is a major cause of their not specifying what they should. Simple misuse of the language in which the document is written is one source of these ambiguities. This handbook describes the ambiguity phenomenon from several points of view, including linguistics, software engineering, and the law. Several strategies for avoiding and detecting ambiguities are presented. Strong emphasis is given on the problems arising from the use of heavily used and seemingly unambiguous words and phrases such as “all”, “each”, and “every” in defining or referencing sets; positioning of “only”, “also”, and “even”; precedences of “and” and “or”; “a”, “all”, “any”, “each”, “one”, “some”, and “the” used as quantifiers; “or” and “and/or”; “that” vs. “which”; parallelism; pronouns referring to an idea; multiple adjectives; etc. Many examples from requirements documents and legal documents are examined.

Although requirements documents and Business Activity Monitoring can provide static and dynamic evidence for requirements compliance, neither provides a formal, real-time presentation of requirements satisfaction. The REQMON research project is constructing and validating methods and tools for requirements specification and real-time monitoring. The challenge is to simplify monitoring system construction while ensuring the fidelity and expressiveness of its feedback. To address this challenge, our integrative approach leverages a formal monitoring abstraction layer, dynamically configurable distributed monitors, and commercial software to define a theory for specifying, developing, and analyzing requirements monitoring systems. This article presents an implementation of rule-based monitors, which are derived from system requirements. Such an implementation can simplify the specification of temporal requirements monitors and can be efficient, as our analysis shows.","2005","2025-04-16 12:38:35","2025-04-16 12:38:35","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://doi.org/10.1109/hicss.2005.306","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our starting point is a dataset of ambiguous phrases from a requirements corpus and associated human judgements about their interpretation. We then use heuristics, based largely on word distribution information, to automatically replicate these judgements. The heuristics eliminate ambiguities which people interpret easily, leaving the nocuous ones to be analysed and rewritten by hand.

Many countries have developed, or are preparing, laws and regulations to combat the related threats and to guarantee personal data protection. Despite efforts to construct secure systems, few papers have, as yet, focused on security from the very outset of the system development life-cycle.

A reusable collection of security requirements and, as a novelty, personal data protection requirements (including information on related software components links) are provided.

However, natural language is inherently ambiguous. Customers and software developers can disagree on the interpretation of a requirement without being aware of this fact. This disagreement can result in disastrous software failures. We argue that ambiguity is a more complex phenomenon than is often recognized in the literature. While inconsistencies and some types of incompleteness can be mechanically detected in formal specifications, ambiguities in informal specicifications often result in incorrect formal specifications. These misinterpretations can be detected only by execution or inspection of the formal specification. We suggest an inspection technique for detecting ambiguities in informal requirement documents before formal specifications are produced in order to avoid misinterpretations, rather than searching for them afterwards. We show how this technique can be tailored to different project contexts with the help of metamodels to increase its effectiveness. Finally, we report on experimental validation of the technique.","2001","2025-04-16 12:38:38","2025-04-16 12:38:38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Detecting%20Ambiguities%20in%20Requirements%20Documents%20Using%20Inspections","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High-level goals of stakeholders are recursively decomposed into lower level ones and eventually into leaf level tasks to be performed by agents. The decomposition structure can also develop through a bottom up approach whereby higher-level goals are introduced as justifications for existing low-level ones. The very concept of decom- position, however, both as process and as artefact is rarely questioned in requirements engineering. In this paper, we argue that it may be of value to give a closer look into goal decomposition and clarify what we actually know about it and what is yet to be understood. We report on an on-going effort to identify empirical work on decomposition coming from various research fields, hoping to find such evidence. We then pose some research questions that we believe need to be pursued in order to improve our understanding of goal decomposition.","2011","2025-04-16 12:38:40","2025-04-16 12:38:40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=The%20mysteries%20of%20goal%20decomposition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
