"Changing legal systems: legal abrogations and annulments in Defeasible Logic","G. Governatori; A. Rotolo","NA; NA","Logic Journal of the IGPL","18 Jan 2018","2010","18","1","157","194","In this paper we investigate how to represent and reason about legal abrogations and annulments in Defeasible Logic. We examine some options that embed in this setting, and in similar rule-based systems, ideas from belief and base revision. In both cases, our conclusion is negative, which suggests to adopt a different logical model. This model expresses temporal aspects of legal rules, and distinguishes between two main timelines, one internal to a given temporal version of the legal system, and another relative to how the legal system evolves over time. Accordingly, we propose a temporal extension of Defeasible Logic suitable to express this model and to capture abrogation and annulment. We show that the proposed framework overcomes the difficulties discussed in regard to belief and base revision, and is sufficiently flexible to represent many of the subtleties characterizing legal abrogations and annulments.","1368-9894","","10.1093/jigpal/jzp075","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8146473","Norm dynamics;Temporal Defeasible Logic;Abrogation and annulment;Belief and base revision","","","1","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"A semantic model for causation in criminal law and the need of logico-legal criteria for the attribution of causation","P. de Sousa Mendes; J. Carmo","NA; NA","Law, Probability and Risk","18 Jan 2018","2013","12","3-4","207","228","Causation as an element of a criminal offence is different from the probative difficulties. The empirical laws that are relevant to the proof of causation, as a pure matter of fact, are not discussed here, but only causality as a category of our understanding and a general law of the intelligible world. This general law of causality is equally valid for all result crimes (e.g. homicide, bodily harm, deception offences and criminal damage). According to the European continental theory of conditions, any ‘conditio sine qua non’ is by itself a cause. Causation is established by the formula of ‘conditio’ (similar to the so-called ‘but for’ test in the common law), which corresponds to a counterfactual reasoning. However, that formula is not able to resolve adequately those cases of causal overdetermination where the result occurred by means of actions of multiple, independently intervening agents. A semantic model of the world evolution, based upon ramified temporal logic, may assist the comprehension of causal connections between human actions and the relevant results. At the end of the day, this model allows us to understand that even in situations where no kind of factual uncertainty is present, doubts upon the attribution of causation to specific agents remain. We shall conclude that the attribution of causation is not a natural problem, but a logico-legal one, that has to be dealt with by way of logico-legal criteria. Nevertheless, attribution of causation must be clearly distinguished from objective imputation of proscribed harm.","1470-840X","","10.1093/lpr/mgt005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8157858","causation;formula of conditio;counterfactuals;attribution of causation;objective imputation","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The primary goal of legal policy simulation is predicting how changes in the law affect measures of interest, e.g., revenue. Currently, legal policies are simulated via a combination of spreadsheets and software code. This poses a validation challenge both due to complexity reasons and due to legal experts lacking the expertise to understand software code. A further challenge is that representative data for simulation may be unavailable, thus necessitating a data generator. We develop a framework for legal policy simulation that is aimed at addressing these challenges. The framework uses models for specifying both legal policies and the probabilistic characteristics of the underlying population. We devise an automated algorithm for simulation data generation. We evaluate our framework through a case study on Luxembourg's Tax Law.","","978-1-4673-6908-4","10.1109/MODELS.2015.7338237","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7338237","Legal Policies;Simulation;UML Profiles;Model-Driven Code Generation;Probabilistic Data Generation","Unified modeling language;Data models;Law;Adaptation models;Probabilistic logic;Computational modeling","","6","","18","IEEE","30 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The core objective is to automatically predict the final judgment outcome, which consists of three parts: relevant legal provisions, charges, and penalties, by analyzing the related information of the case. Most existing studies treat the prediction of the three parts as separate tasks, and few consider the logical relationships between the subtasks. Additionally, some studies only establish multi-task learning models from the perspective of shared features, which fails to fully leverage the consistency constraints among subtasks. Therefore, this paper proposes a method based on multi-task learning, considering the logical relationships between subtasks, aiming to deeply explore the relevance between subtasks and guide the model to perform interpretable reasoning.

However, researchers struggle to classify confusing criminal cases, such as robbery and theft, which requires LJP models to distinguish the nuances between similar crimes. Existing methods usually design handcrafted features to pick up necessary semantic legal clues to make more accurate legal judgment predictions. In this paper, we propose a Semantic-Aware Dual Encoder Model (SEMDR), which designs a novel legal clue tracing mechanism to conduct fine-grained semantic reasoning between criminal facts and instruments. Our legal clue tracing mechanism is built from three reasoning levels: 1) Lexicon-Tracing, which aims to extract criminal facts from criminal descriptions; 2) Sentence Representation Learning, which contrastively trains language models to better represent confusing criminal facts; 3) Multi-Fact Reasoning, which builds a reasons graph to propagate semantic clues among fact nodes to capture the subtle difference among criminal facts. Our legal clue tracing mechanism helps SEMDR achieve state-of-the-art on the CAIL2018 dataset and shows its advance in few-shot scenarios. Our experiments show that SEMDR has a strong ability to learn more uniform and distinguished representations for criminal facts, which helps to make more accurate predictions on confusing criminal cases and reduces the model uncertainty during making judgments.

In this article, these approaches are discussed in light of a distinction between direct and indirect probabilistic reasoning. Direct probabilistic reasoning directly reasons from evidence to hypotheses, whereas indirect probabilistic reasoning reasons from hypotheses to evidence (and then back to the hypotheses). While statistical and story-based approaches usually model indirect probabilistic reasoning, argumentation-based approaches usually model direct probabilistic reasoning. It has been suggested that all legal probabilistic reasoning should be indirect, but in this article, it is argued that direct probabilistic reasoning has a rational basis and is, moreover, sometimes easier to perform for judges than indirect probabilistic reasoning. Moreover, direct probabilistic reasoning can be analysed in terms of standard probability theory, resulting in an alternative, non-Bayesian use of the terms ‘prior’ and ‘posterior’ probability and without the need to estimate unconditional probabilities of the hypotheses.","1470-840X","","10.1093/lpr/mgu013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8157950","legal proof;statistics;narrative;argumentation;probabilistic reasoning","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Objective: This paper looks at how Indian legal laws could be analysed and understood using artificial neural networks (ANN). Great numbers of statutes, precedents, and interpretations define India’s complex legal environment. Conventional manual legal document analysis is sometimes timeconsuming and prone to human error; so, automated methods that can provide more accurate and efficient analysis are much needed. Methodology: We developed a model utilising ANN to manage this challenge by analysing and classifying legal documents depending on their content, context, and application to particular regulatory systems. The method consists in tagged with domain-specific tags training a neural network on a large collection of legal documents comprising statutes, case laws, and legal commentary. Using modern optimisation techniques including dropout regularisation and backpropagation, the ANN model was modified to increase its generalising capacity. According to the results, accuracy and efficiency have greatly raised themselves as compared to more traditional methods. Results and Findings: In determining legal language, the ANN model achieved an accuracy of $\mathbf{9 2. 3 \%}$, a precision of $\mathbf{9 0. 1 \%}$, a recall of 91.7%, and an $F 1$ score of 90.9%. The model also cut the time required for legal document interpretation, by roughly 45% as compared to traditional methods. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate how fast and consistently artificial intelligence can grasp legal texts, hence transforming legal analysis and regulatory compliance in India.","","979-8-3315-4121-7","10.1109/ICAICCIT64383.2024.10912260","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10912260","Artificial Neural Networks;Legal Analysis;Indian Regulations;AI in Law;Text Classification;Machine Learning","Training;Analytical models;Accuracy;Recurrent neural networks;Law;Text categorization;Artificial neural networks;Regulation;Artificial intelligence;Pragmatics","","","","15","IEEE","13 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Leveraging multilingual embeddings and domain-specific knowledge, the model demonstrates improved accuracy in tasks such as named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and document categorization across a range of languages. Additionally, the optimization framework emphasizes the importance of domain adaptation, acknowledging the nuances and variations in legal terminology across different legal systems. Through a combination of transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies, the model adapts to specific legal domains, ensuring robust performance in diverse legal contexts. Experimental results on a comprehensive dataset of multilingual legal documents validate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization framework. Comparative analyses with baseline models showcase significant improvements in precision, recall, and overall model performance.

Many standards and features based on XML have emerged which make it possible to reuse former categorisation methods common in library science. One of them is RDF. As there has always been an interaction between legal documentation and the technical means available for this task, the paper examines the possibility of using RDF for representing legal knowledge. It is derived from the commercial publishing project Legalo, initiated by epico Informationssysteme GmbH. This was set up as a legal information site on the Internet. It incorporates huge amounts of heterogenous legal data, including bills, decisions, Internet-links, contributions of authors etc. The article explores the advantage of this approach and some further steps towards the automated assembling of legal topics into ""legal information packages"" in relation to the user needs and inputs.","","0-7695-1230-5","10.1109/DEXA.2001.953089","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=953089","","Law;Legal factors;Knowledge representation;Internet;Resource description framework;XML;Libraries;Documentation;Publishing;Assembly","","3","4","9","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While higher-level decision procedures have enhanced capacity for problems of amenable syntax, little prior work has addressed (1) the generalization of many critical synergistic algorithms beyond bit-blasted representations, nor (2) the issue of bridging higher-level techniques to problems of complex circuit-accurate syntax. In this paper, we extend a variety of bit-level algorithms to designs with memory arrays, and introduce techniques to rewrite arrays from circuit-accurate to verification-amenable behavioral syntax. These extensions have numerous motivations, from scaling formal methods to verify ever-growing design components, to enabling hardware model checkers to reason about software-like systems, to allowing state-of-the-art model checkers to support temporally-consistent function- and predicate-abstraction.","","978-0-9835678-0-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5770934","","Arrays;Logic gates;Logic arrays;Redundancy;Pins;Cognition;Data models","","","","23","","19 May 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, one practical microsystem is constructed based on ARM7-CPU embedded into db4 wavelet analysis in tendem of multy-fractal extracting. Then five subjects are invited and tested in processing near infrared 940 nm otopoint-signals. Nonlinear power law model was extracted in form of $Ps=Pc^{\wedge}a$ with base-line of calm state, wherein $a1$ fitted with wavelet analysis signature, and $a2$ with wavelet analysis in tendem of multy-fractal feature. The interesting results include that $a2$ means are decreasing basicly in self stimulus condition of smile, truth and lie versus calm.

By adding MRAC law to the usual robust LQ control system, it is expected that the system output tracks to the reference signal even if there exist larger parameter perturbations that are not guaranteed in the robust LQ controller synthesis process. Through tracking to the reference signal, we expect that proposed system improves the robust control performance. The proposed system is synthesized by two-step approach. It is well known that if a controller is synthesized for a system with parameter perturbations, the tracking performance of the closed loop system is not as good as that of the closed loop with the nominal plant and a controller synthesized for the nominal plant. For this reason, a robust LQ controller is synthesized for a small perturbation, firstly. Then MRAC low is adopted for the closed loop with the plant and the robust LQ controller to improve the tracking performance when there exist large perturbations. LMI based stability analysis method for MIMO system is developed after Yang et al's method[6]. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by some experiments using a test-scale 2 Degree-of-Freedom (2DOF) helicopter.","","978-1-922107-63-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6613229","Robust LQ Control;Model Reference Adaptive Control;LMI analysis;Polytopic Uncertainties;MIMO Helicopter","Robustness;Uncertainty;Helicopters;Adaptation models;Stability analysis;Mathematical model;Propellers","","1","","8","","30 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In time domain, through this simulate system, user can design and adjust the control law for separation aircraft. Considering the inertia of control system, the real time aerodynamics is delayed for control system. At the same time, control surfaces' deflection angle and angle velocity saturation are considering. The result of simulation indicated that the generic control law for aircraft flight is not suit to controlling separation. The reason for this phenomena is severity unsteady interfere aerodynamics action on separation aircraft. Additional exciter is introduced by control surfaces' deflection angle and angle velocity saturation. The exciter brings on control motion's oscillatory and divergence.

"10 Was It Good for You Too? The New Natural Law Theory and the Paradoxical Good of Sexbots","J. Danaher; N. McArthur","NA; NA","Robot Sex: Social and Ethical Implications","","2017","","","173","200","The New Natural Law Theory (NNLT), associated with thinkers such as Germain Grisez, John Finnis, and Robert George, has emerged as a noted, if not prominent, force in ethical theory since the 1960s. It is an attempt to revive and update Thomistic philosophy to meet modern moral challenges. If we think of NNLT at all, it is both for its complex moral theory of how sex and human fulfillment fit together, and for the rather limited set of human sexual acts and decisions that fit within the moral horizon it sketches. Within this horizon falls “reproductive-type” sex, but only insofar as it occurs within and for the sake of different-sex marriage. Irretrievably beyond that horizon for the NNLT sexual ethic is masturbation, all reproductive-type sex outside of or only contingently related to marriage (e.g., “adultery,” “fornication”), and all complete sex of an intrinsically non-reproductive-type regardless of the relational or physical configuration it takes (e.g., “sodomy,” oral, or contracepted sex).1 On the face of it, then, an account of sexbots based on the NNLT sexual ethic promises to be brief. The mere existence of sexbots would seem to signal that our relations with them are going to be masturbatory, certainly non-reproductive, and a simulation of adultery (if we are married) or fornication (if we are not). In other words, sexbots simply would appear to be outside the NNLT's moral horizon. In terms of new and interesting moral insights into sexbots, a NNLT account seems to promise only its rather sophisticated (some might say “casuistical”2) reasoning for these wrongs and how they apply to sex with robots.","","9780262341981","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8232960.pdf&bkn=8169742&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","25 Dec 2017","","","MIT Press","MIT Press eBook Chapters"

"How clear is transparent? Reporting expert reasoning in legal cases","M. J. Sjerps; C. E. H. Berger","NA; NA","Law, Probability and Risk","18 Jan 2018","2012","11","4","317","329","Experts providing evidence in legal cases are universally recommended to be transparent, particularly in their reasoning, so that legal practitioners can critically check whether the conclusions are adequately supported by the results. However, when exploring the practical meaning of this recommendation it becomes clear that people have different things in mind. The UK appeal court case R v T painfully exposes the different views. In this article we argue that there can be a trade-off between clarity and transparency, and that in some cases it is impossible for the legal practitioner to be able to follow the expert’s reasoning in full detail because of the level of complexity. All that can be expected in these cases is that the legal practitioner is able to understand the reasoning up to a certain level. We propose that experts should only report the main arguments, but must make this clear and provide further details on request. Reporting guidelines should address the reasoning in more detail. Legal practitioners and scientists should not be telling each other what to do in the setting of a legal case, but in other settings more discussion will be beneficial to both. We see the likelihood ratio framework and Bayesian networks as tools to promote transparency and logic.

Some of the application areas envisioned for intelligent legal systems include retrieval systems, argument and reasoning systems, legal decision-making systems, and drafting systems. Successful implementation of systems of these types has been hampered by a lack of adequate knowledge representation for the underlying legal concepts. We need both representations of everyday situations and of subtle legal concepts like rights, duties, and contracts. This paper reviews some of the recent work in representing legal situations and discusses the special knowledge representation questions that arise in developing legal information processing systems.

Compared with general documents, legal case documents are typically long text sequences with intrinsic logical structures. However, most existing pre-trained language models (PLMs) struggle with understanding the long-distance dependencies between different sections within the complex structure of legal case documents. Another unique challenge in Taiwan Legal field is the lack of labeled datasets. This deficiency makes it difficult to accurately evaluate model performance. To date, models in Taiwan have yet to be specifically trained on legal case data. Given these challenges, this research aims to develop a model that can effectively understand and process long legal case documents and accurately retrieve similar legal cases. This research proposes a Longformer-LSTM model, Taiwan Legal Longformer, combining Longformer and LSTM in a sequenced manner. The Longformer, pre-trained on a Taiwanese legal case corpus, serves as the base model, processing input documents and generating context embeddings that capture local and global dependencies. These embeddings are then processed by the LSTM layer, adept at capturing long-distance dependencies in sequences. The model in this research is evaluated using our dataset and the Average Entropy of the Reason Clustering (AERC) metric, which is based on the assumption that case scenarios under the same reason of legal cases are similar. Compared with baseline models such as CKIP BERT Base Chinese and Longformer, our experimental results illustrate our model's advancements in handling similarity comparisons within extensive legal judgments.","","979-8-3503-0706-1","10.1109/WAIE60568.2023.00036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10496972","Legal Artificial Intelligence;Language Model;Computation and Language","Measurement;Law;Education;Propulsion;Predictive models;Natural language processing;Entropy","","","","26","IEEE","18 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Its main aim is to process natural (human) language using computer programs. Text classification is one of the main tasks of this field, and they are widely used in many different applications such as spam filtering, sentiment analysis, and document categorization. Nonetheless, there is only very little text classification work in the law domain and even less for the Turkish language. This may be attributed to the complexity within the domain. The length, complexity of documents, and use of extensive technical jargon are some of the reasons that distinguish this domain from others. Similar to the medical domain, understanding these documents requires extensive specialization. Another reason can be the scarcity of publicly available datasets. In this study, we compile sizeable unsupervised and supervised datasets from publicly available sources and experiment with several classification algorithms ranging from traditional classifiers to much more complicated deep learning and transformer-based models along with different text representations. We focus on classifying Court of Cassation decisions for their crime labels. Interestingly, the majority of the models we experiment with could be able to obtain good results. This suggests that although understanding the documents in the legal domain is complicated and requires expertise from humans, it may be relatively easier for machine learning models despite the extensive presence of the technical terms. This seems to be especially the case for transformer-based pre-trained neural language models which can be adapted to the law domain, showing high potential for future real-world applications.","2768-7295","978-1-6654-9810-4","10.1109/INISTA55318.2022.9894051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9894051","Legal document classification;Natural Language Processing;Domain-specific language models","Adaptation models;Technological innovation;Sentiment analysis;Law;Text categorization;Linguistics;Transformers","","7","","29","IEEE","23 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Modelling postglacial sea levels with power-law rheology and a realistic ice model in the absence of ambient tectonic stress","P. Wu","NA","Geophysical Journal International","18 Jan 2018","1999","139","3","691","702","Previous studies of postglacial rebound with power-law rheology and simple ice models over Laurentia have found that sea-level data in the transition zone (e.g. Boston) cannot be easily explained unless non-linear rheology is restricted to lie within a thin layer between the lithosphere and the upper mantle. The reason is the existence of a viscously stationary zone, which is characteristic of non-linear mantles. In this study, the simple ice model is replaced by a realistic ice history adapted from the ICE-3G model, which takes into account important effects such as retreating ice margins and eustatic ocean loading. A 3-D finite element model is used to calculate the deformation and the relative sea levels in eastern Canada and along the US east coast. The purpose is to investigate whether the realistic load model allows sea-level data near the centre of rebound and along the Atlantic east coast of Canada and the USA to be explained by non-linear rheology simultaneously.The assumptions made are that: (1) postglacial rebound sees the steady-state creep and not the transient creep; (2) either ambient tectonic stresses do not interact with rebound stress or the ambient stress level is low; (3) lateral heterogeneity of rock properties and anisotropic flow can be neglected.Results indicate that the retreating ice margin does make it easier for non-linear rheology in the mantle to explain the sea-level data in the transition zone around Boston. However, reconciling all the sea-level data near the centre of rebound and along the Atlantic east coast simultaneously is still difficult for a non-linear rheology. So far, two types of models with non-linear rheology have been found to be able to explain the sea-level data inside and outside Laurentia simultaneously. They are: (1) earth models with a thin (≤270km) non-linear zone overlying a 1021 Pa s lower mantle; (2) earth models with a linear upper mantle with an average viscosity of 1021?Pa?s overlying a non-linear lower mantle with A*=3×10−35Pa−3s−1 and n=3.","1365-246X","","10.1046/j.1365-246x.1999.00965.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8139810","creep;finite element methods;glacial rebound;rheology;sea level;viscoelasticity;viscosity.","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Especially in the judicial domain, it plays a significant role not only in enhancing the completeness of legal knowledge graphs but also in improving the accuracy of legal supervisory inference. Due to extensive legal expertise, complex entity relationships, and strict requirements for interpretable reasoning, traditional methods, such as embedding-based methods and those that utilize pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT), often fail to delve into deep semantic information or overlook the interconnections among triples, which leads to significant shortcomings in generalizability and capabilities in practical applications. Motivated by the great generation power of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a legal knowledge graph completion model based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), which we have named RA-KG-LLM. This model effectively combines the generative capabilities of LLMs with retrieval-augmented technology to enhance the semantic information and interrelations mining within knowledge graphs. The retrieval framework within our model utilizes text embeddings and vector similarity matching to provide the LLM with relevant triples, while fine-tuning techniques are employed to infuse the semantic information from the knowledge graph into the LLM. Extensive experiments on five real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and potentiality in the judicial field of the proposed model. Specifically, on the legal domain dataset Cail2022, it achieves better Hits@1 score in the relation prediction task than the state-of-the-art related works.","","979-8-3503-9136-7","10.1109/DSC63484.2024.00033","Research and Development; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10859004","Large Language Models;Judicial Knowledge Graph;Knowledge Graph Completion;Retrieval-Augmented Generation","Law;Large language models;Retrieval augmented generation;Semantics;Knowledge graphs;Predictive models;Data models;Cognition;Vectors;Filling","","","","34","IEEE","4 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

GOF (goodness-of-fit) tests for the PLP have attracted much attention. However, the practical use of the PLP model is its graphical analysis or the Duane plot, which is a log-log plot of the cumulative number of failures versus time. This has been commonly used for model validation and parameter estimation. When a plot is made, and the coefficient of determination, R/sup 2/, of the regression line is computed, the model can be tested based on this value. This paper introduces a statistical test, based on this simple procedure. The distribution of R/sup 2/ under the PLP hypothesis is shown not to depend on the true model parameters. Hence, it is possible to build a statistical GOF test for the PLP. The critical values of the test depend only on the sample size. Simulations show that this test is reasonably powerful compared with the usual PLP GOF tests. It is sometimes more powerful, especially for deteriorating systems. Implementing this test needs only the computation of a coefficient of determination. It is much easier than, for example, computing an Anderson-Darling statistic. Further study is needed to compare more precisely this new test with the existing ones. But the R/sup 2/ test provides a very simple and useful objective approach for decision making with regard to model validation.","1558-1721","","10.1109/TR.2002.805784","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1179801","","Testing;Power system modeling;Regression analysis;Parameter estimation;Power system reliability;Systems engineering and theory;Failure analysis;Computational modeling;Statistics;Decision making","","35","","26","IEEE","19 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The results of this method are less dependent on astrophysical assumptions than in many other methods. For systems with accurately measured positions and time-delays, the most important uncertainty is related to the mass model used. Simple parametric models like isothermal ellipsoidal mass distributions seem to provide consistent results with a reasonably small scatter when applied to several lens systems. We discuss a family of models with a separable radial power law and an arbitrary angular dependence for the potential ψ=rβF(θ). Isothermal potentials are a special case of these models with β=1. An additional external shear is used to take into account perturbations from other galaxies. Using a simple linear formalism for quadruple lenses, we can derive H0 as a function of the observables and the shear. If the latter is fixed, the result depends on the assumed power-law exponent according to H0∝(2-β)/β. The effect of external shear is quantified by introducing a ‘critical shear’γc as a measure for the amount of shear that changes the result significantly. The analysis shows that in the general case H0 and γc do not depend on the position of the lens galaxy. Spherical lens models with images close to the Einstein radius with fitted external shear differ by a factor of β/2 from shearless models, leading to H0∝2-β in this case. We discuss these results and compare them with numerical models for a number of real lens systems.","1365-2966","","10.1046/j.1365-8711.2002.05426.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8159775","gravitational lensing;quasars: individual: Q2237+0305;quasars: individual: PG 1115+080;quasars: individual: RX J0911.4+0551;quasars: individual: B1608+656;distance scale","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

FOPL provides a formal representation of legal concepts, rules, and relationships, enabling the development of intelligent systems capable of analyzing divorce cases and extracting pertinent information. By harnessing FOPL, this research aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of legal systems analysis. The paper explores the design and implementation of a FOPL-based system for divorce case analysis and furthermore, it uncovers challenges and future directions.","","979-8-3503-0525-8","10.1109/GCAT59970.2023.10353499","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10353499","Data and knowledge engineering;divorce cases;legal precedents;First Order Predicate Logic;intelligent systems","Knowledge engineering;Privacy;Ethics;Law;Decision making;Collaboration;Transforms","","","","27","IEEE","19 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While recent advancements in natural language processing have shown promise, existing approaches often struggle to capture the sophisticated interplay between facts, legal principles, and precedents that characterize legal decision-making. This paper introduces LegalReasoner, a novel multi-stage framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and integrates domain-specific knowledge for enhanced legal judgment prediction. Our approach encompasses four key stages: 1) legal knowledge infusion, where we pre-train an LLM on a vast corpus of legal literature using contrastive learning techniques; 2) case-law retrieval, employing a graph neural network to identify relevant precedents and statutes; 3) multi-hop reasoning, utilizing a transformer-based architecture with a hierarchical attention mechanism to navigate complex legal arguments; and 4) judgment synthesis, where we employ a generative adversarial network to produce coherent and legally sound judgments. We evaluate LegalReasoner on two diverse datasets: the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) cases and the Chinese AI and Law Challenge (CAIL2018). Our framework demonstrates substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average accuracy increase of 7.8% across all datasets. Furthermore, we conduct extensive ablation studies and interpretability analyses to elucidate the contributions of each component and provide insights into the model’s decision-making process. Our work not only advances the field of automated legal reasoning but also offers a transparent and explainable system that could serve as a valuable tool for legal professionals. By bridging the gap between AI and legal expertise, LegalReasoner paves the way for more efficient, consistent, and fair legal decision-making processes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3496666","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10750819","Legal judgment prediction;large language models;knowledge integration;multi-hop reasoning","Law;Cognition;Artificial intelligence;Predictive models;Natural language processing;Decision making;Large language models;Transformers;Contrastive learning;Knowledge based systems","","","","21","CCBYNCND","12 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In addition, for some situations the legislation is silent and it is up to the judiciary to decide according to the specific case, thus making this matter even more complex and difficult to elucidate. The reasons for wanting to formalize the Law of Succession with the help of formal language and the creation of systems capable of inferring assumptions in situations with a high load of rules and restrictions are countless. Formalization improves the exact and specific understanding of a text because it helps highlight ambiguities, unintended readings or interpretations, increases accurate understanding and avoids misinterpretation of legal text arising from frequent amendments and revisions of legislation and jurisprudence. This results in an expansion of access to information, productivity growth, information qualification, better control of deadlines, increased efficiency and cost reduction. This work explores, therefore, a formalization of knowledge and legal reasoning of Succession Law through an approach known as Fluents Calculus, highlighting possibilities and limits in the automation of tasks in the area.","2166-0727","978-989-33-4792-8","10.23919/CISTI58278.2023.10211651","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10211651","fluent calculus;knowledge representation;right of succession;legal automation","Productivity;Automation;Law;Decision making;Legislation;Formal languages;Calculus","","","","0","","15 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To fix the problems with current methods, this study presents a new model-based evaluation metric that is designed to work well with legal QA systems. We are looking into the basic ideas that are needed for this kind of metric, as well as the problems of putting it into practice in the real world, finding the right technological frameworks, creating good evaluation methods. We talk about a theory framework that is based on legal standards and computational linguistics. We also talk about how the metric was created and how it can be used in real life.

Mostly a man with a need for judicial assistance approaches with an advocate to deal with his case, but this may not be useful when a person is interested in knowing and applying the exact law approach to petty issues in his life and also to avoid being a scapegoat at sometimes by few advocates who elongates the case system for his benefits. The proposed approach has an intelligent hybrid agent system composed of two subsystems, law gatherer and law decider to address the two key issues, finding out right laws and making a right choice. The law gatherer subsystem is based on the ontology web service architecture to define the ontology which is used for processing the semantic content of gathered law information. The law gatherer subsystem is composed of a knowledge system that combines Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and Rule-Based Reasoning (RBR). Simple Object Access protocol (SOAP) is used for establishing the communication interface and gathering XML-based contents between the agent system and the database system created, through remote procedure calls with condition parameters. In the second subsystem Law Decider, the Analytic Hierarchy Process which is a structured technique for dealing with complex decisions is used to make an optimal decision for satisfying the case structure of the individual. The proposed Hybrid agent system will assist the people with no judicial knowledge to feed their case details into the system to get the appropriate law suitable for that particular instance.","","978-1-4577-0878-7","10.1109/IAMA.2011.6049001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6049001","Intelligent Agent;Web Service;Ontology;Artificial Intelligence;Analytic Hierarchy Process;case-based reasoning;rule-based systems","Cognition;Equations;Mathematical model;Ontologies;Law;Database systems","","","","9","IEEE","20 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, for bigger models and/or models with mixed abundance of molecules, stochastic simulation fails to produce the required results in reasonable time. Parallel simulation can offer a solution for this challenge. Nevertheless, currently available parallel software tools either provide a coarse-grained parallelization or a general-purpose fine-grained parallel simulation of the well-known stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA). The former can only take advantage of parallel processing if multiple runs have to be performed, while the latter requires extensive synchronization and communication between the different processing nodes each time a reaction is to fire. In this paper, a fine-grained parallelization approach is presented that takes advantage of the underlying model semantics to improve the simulator performance. The proposed method is applied to the yeast cell cycle regulation, which is an example of biological models that requires extensive investigation.","2156-6100","978-1-5090-2987-7","10.1109/CIBEC.2016.7836132","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7836132","Cell Cycle Regulation;Parallel Stochastic Simulation;Semantics-based Parallelization","Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Stochastic processes;Mathematical model;Firing;Biological systems","","1","","9","IEEE","30 Jan 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, since the radial scale at which strong lensing features are formed corresponds to the transition from the dominance of baryonic matter to dark matter, there is no known reason why galaxies should follow a power law in density. The assumption of a power law artificially breaks the mass-sheet degeneracy, a well-known invariance transformation in gravitational lensing which affects the product of Hubble constant and time delay and can therefore cause a bias in the determination of H0 from the time-delay technique. In this paper, we use the Illustris hydrodynamical simulations to estimate the amplitude of this bias, and to understand how it is related to observational properties of galaxies. Investigating a large sample of Illustris galaxies that have velocity dispersion σSIE ≥ 160 km s−1 at redshifts below z = 1, we find that the bias on H0 introduced by the power-law assumption can reach 20–50 per cent, with a scatter of 10–30 per cent (rms). However, we find that by selecting galaxies with an inferred power-law model slope close to isothermal, it is possible to reduce the bias on H0 to ≲ 5  per  cent and the scatter to ≲ 10  per  cent. This could potentially be used to form less biased statistical samples for H0 measurements in the upcoming large survey era.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2708","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198313","gravitational lensing: strong;galaxies: haloes;galaxies: structure;cosmology: theory;dark matter","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

In this article, we partially solve one open problem associated with this property. Specifically, we mainly devote ourselves to solving the general form of the law of importation $I(U(x,y),z)=I(x,I(y,z))$, where $I$ is a fuzzy implication and $U$ is a conjunctive uninorm with a continuous underlying t-norm and a continuous underlying t-conorm.

However, empirical evidence points to the limitations of PIDL for learning certain types of PDEs. In this paper, we (a) present the challenges in training PIDL architecture, (b) contrast the performance of PIDL architecture in learning a first order scalar hyperbolic conservation law and its parabolic counterpart, (c) investigate the effect of training data sampling, which corresponds to various sensing scenarios in traffic networks, (d) comment on the implications of PIDL limitations for traffic flow estimation and prediction in practice. Case studies present the contrast in PIDL results between learning the traffic flow model (LWR PDE) and its diffusive variation. The outcome indicates that PIDL experiences significant challenges in learning the hyperbolic LWR equation due to the non-smoothness of its solution. Conversely, the architecture with parabolic PDE, augmented with the diffusion term, leads to the successful reassembly of the density data even with the shockwaves present. The paper concludes by providing a discussion on recent assessments of reasons behind the challenge PIDL encounters with hyperbolic PDEs and the corresponding mitigation strategies.","2687-7813","","10.1109/OJITS.2023.3268026","UCF College of Graduate Studies Open Access Publishing Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10105558","Physics-informed deep learning;neural network training;partial differential equations;transportation models;scalar conservation laws;PIDL;PINN","Mathematical models;Training;Neural networks;Deep learning;Data models;Sensors;Task analysis;Physics;Difference equations","","12","","83","CCBY","19 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this context, performance modeling refers to the measuring of important business aspects in a coordinated manner and the use of these measurements for improved decision making. Goal modeling techniques have shown to be beneficial when expressing and analyzing performance models. Since most regulations are still written in natural language, support for the transformation of regulatory text into performance models is needed. This allows regulators and regulated parties to keep working with familiar natural language regulations and to use goal models indirectly while avoiding a potentially significant learning curve for goal-modeling techniques. In this paper, we present such a tool-supported transformation to goal models expressed with the User Requirements Notation that enables reasoning about outcome-based regulations via widely available evaluation mechanism for goal models.

The construction of gravity sand retaining dams (hereinafter referred to as sand retaining dams) from the formation area to the circulation area is one of the quick and effective measures. Prevention and control projects often play a role in controlling the development trend of debris flow and reducing the size and frequency of debris flow. Debris flow will cause erosion and impact damage to the dam foundation of sand retaining dams. For the debris flow impact force, the most dangerous part is usually designed based on the largest impact force, while all parts of the dam body are designed according to the most dangerous part, which wastes materials. It's not economical. In this study, a debris flow gully is selected as the research model. Considering the interaction between debris flow and sand retaining dam, the impact simulation of debris flow on sand retaining dam was carried out. The research results show that the existence of the sand retaining dam hinders the movement process of debris flow, changes its speed and direction of movement, and in addition, the impact force varies at different places of upstream face of sand retaining dam. Research results provide a scientific and reasonable theoretical basis and design reference for the stability of sand retaining dam under debris flow impact impact.

It can be used for students to learn the skill of the legal argument, or provides an advice for the attorneys in practice.","","0-7803-6456-2","10.1109/IECON.2000.973151","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=973151","","Law;Legal factors;Hybrid intelligent systems;Fuzzy systems;Expert systems;Fuzzy logic;Fuzzy reasoning;Contracts;Marketing and sales;Humans","","2","","5","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The long-standing practice based on the IEC ‘second summation law’ has been called into question by observations on single-phase AC string inverters at a US solar farm site. Many practitioners therefore advocate a conservative approach where no diversity in current phase angles is assumed and current magnitudes are purely additive. In this paper, a straightforward analysis of data collected by a solar inverter OEM is offered as evidence that the IEC summation law provides realistic estimates of aggregate harmonic currents from solar farms, and conversely, there is a reasonable likelihood that the conservative approach leads to inefficient design and unnecessary costs.","","978-1-6654-7164-0","10.1109/ETFG55873.2023.10408521","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10408521","Harmonic distortion;Power conversion harmonics;Power system harmonics;Power quality;Solar power generation","Power measurement;Current measurement;Aggregates;Power system harmonics;Harmonic analysis;Mathematical models;Optimization","","","","8","IEEE","2 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Three mathematical characteristics of tonal music melody are found based on music composition theory. The constrained entropy maximization model (CEMM) is constructed, and the power-law distribution of melodic intervals is the result of solving the problem formulated in this model. Three other typical power-law models in economics, linguistics/informatics, and design of complex engineering systems are reviewed, and their goal orientation behaviors are analyzed. It is found that the models quantifying different social behaviors with goal orientation are consistent with the unified model. The power law is actually the result of the well-known social distribution mechanisms with limited resources, such as the maximal wealth with limited economic capability, the minimal cost under constrained resources, and the maximal entropy with restrictions. If without limit or constraint, these social systems would not observe the power law.

Accurately characterizing the throughput capacity of 3D-MANET is becoming increasingly critical. For the convenience of model solving, the prior work has typically been analyzed based on the uniform or specific probability distribution of network nodes, but ignoring such the node distribution is difficult to describe the real application scene. With was formerly different, in this paper, we propose a cell-gridded 3D network model in which movement and distribution of nodes follow Zipf’s law with exponent $\varphi$ (many scholars have proved this law to conform to the movement law of the actual world). Moreover, our model can cover a variety of distribution scenarios with changes in $\varphi$ value. We derived the packet delivery rate and network throughput capacity scaling law under the two-hop relay routing algorithm with the help of Zipf’s law and classical capacity analysis theories and discussed the impact of $\varphi$ on capacity. Additionally, our research findings indicate that if we can fully utilize network users’ movement and distribution status information in different areas and reasonably divide network cells, it will be expected to improve network throughput capacity performance.","","978-1-6654-9508-0","10.1109/ICTC55111.2022.9778767","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9778767","3D-MANET;Throughput capacity;Zipf’s law","Solid modeling;Analytical models;Three-dimensional displays;Throughput;Routing;Probability distribution;Communications technology","","1","","14","IEEE","23 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this issue, a novel named entity recognition approach for legal instruments based on improved few-shot learning is introduced in this paper. This approach enables named entity recognition of a large amount of unknown legal data with a small amount of annotated data on legal instruments. Firstly, data augmentation is employed to expand the training sample, and a BERT pre-training model is used to obtain word vectors of the text data. Subsequently, the NNshot model is applied to learn text data features and perform classification. Then, a Viterbi decoder based on label-pair rules is used to capture the dependencies between categories, correct the NNshot prediction results, and select the optimal classification sequence. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed named entity recognition method is reasonably reliable and can overcome the challenge that entities cannot be accurately recognized due to insufficient annotation data.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3484765","Fundamental Research Funds for the Provincial Universities of Zhejiang(grant numbers:RF-C2023007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10731673","Named entity recognition;legal instruments;data augmentation;Viterbi decoder;improved few-shot learning","Hidden Markov models;Law;Vectors;Instruments;Viterbi algorithm;Data models;Training;Games;Decoding;Data augmentation","","","","48","CCBYNCND","23 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

For-profit enforcement is considered to be one possible reason for this phenomenon. This causality is articulated using an evolutionary model. There are two types of agents in this model, the first type is civilians who are bounded rational, and decide on whether to abide a law by learning from each other in a short time horizon; the other type is the law enforcement agency, who has higher rationality, and will choose optimal inspection frequency and punishment strength to maximize their payoff in a long time horizon, with the knowledge of how the civilians update their strategies. It is revealed that, if the enforcement agency can obtain benefit from the fines collected in the enforcement, their optimal choice is not to enforce the law strictly, but to adopt a moderate inspection frequency and punishment strength, because this induces more civilians to violate the law and brings the agency higher income. However, this intended lenient enforcement leads to a pervasive law-violation in the society.","2639-4235","978-1-7281-5857-0","10.1109/ICCSS48103.2019.9115444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9115444","Evolutionary game theory;Pervasive law-violation;For-profit law enforcement;Fine;Discretion abuse","","","","","13","IEEE","12 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A hypothesis is tested, that using a small set of labelled data, deeper and more accurate models for the processing of legal documents can be constructed. This will automate the processing of legal documents hence decreasing, and ultimately eliminating the backlog that currently exists throughout various legal systems. This work can be generalized for legal appeals cases in diverse fields. The various configurations used to train the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model will be compared along with a variety of embeddings. The experiments obtained their highest accuracy using the Bi-LSTM model with 300-dimensional GloVe embeddings compared to the previous techniques used for the semantic understanding of law related documents.","2325-6516","978-1-7281-6332-1","10.1109/ICSC.2020.00089","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9031483","Classification, Bi LSTMs, Embeddings, Rhetorical Role","Law;Semantics;Neural networks;Support vector machines;Task analysis;Legislation","","9","","26","IEEE","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It filters even the uncertainty of the precision of the sensors. Therefore, the intelligent vehicle may move as smoothly as a well-skilled or experienced human being along straight and curved routes on the hostile location or battlefield. Motion control for an intelligent vehicle requires many of the same elements that the military command, control communication and intelligence (C/sup 3/I) systems use.

Since most legal data are presented in text, using natural language processing (NLP) to solve legal question answering is a current research direction. Compared with traditional question answering tasks, legal question answering often contains some potential information, such as legal events, crime process, litigants, and victims. This potential information suggests the legal question answering model reasoning's theme and can help the model improve its reasoning ability. In addition, the legal question answering task must answer based on relevant legal clauses, and the number of relevant legal clauses is usually a lot. Hence, the model needs to eliminate the influence of redundant and noisy clauses. Therefore, we propose a double-granularity-based graph neural network that can reason through potential legal events. Based on this research, we design an attention mechanism based on text interaction and calculate the attention by different window sizes score to decrease the influence of noise graph nodes. Finally, we evaluate the proposed model on the JEC-QA benchmark dataset to demonstrate our method's effectiveness. Experimental results show that the model performs well on the Chinese legal examination data and outperforms classical baselines. Out-performs the best baseline model by 7.08 in overall performance and outperforms the best baseline model in single-choice and multiple-choice questions; they are 7.52 and 6.41, respectively.","2161-4407","978-1-6654-8867-9","10.1109/IJCNN54540.2023.10192015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10192015","Graph neural network;Double-granularity;Legal Question Answering","Adaptation models;Law;Scalability;Benchmark testing;Question answering (information retrieval);Cognition;Graph neural networks","","","","29","IEEE","2 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Most existing studies have considered task dependencies while neglecting the prior dependencies of labels among different tasks. Therefore, how to make better use of the information on the relation dependencies among tasks and labels becomes a crucial issue. To this end, we transform the text classification problem into a node classification framework based on graph reasoning and supervised contrastive learning (SCL) techniques, named GraSCL. Specifically, we first design a graph reasoning network to model the potential dependency structures and facilitate relational learning under various graph topologies. Then, we introduce the SCL method for the LJP task to further leverage the label relation on the graph. To accommodate the node classification settings, we extend the traditional SCL method to novel variants for SCL at the node level, which allows the GraSCL framework to be trained efficiently even with small batches. Furthermore, to recognize the importance of hard negative samples in contrastive learning, we introduce a simple yet effective technique called online hard negative mining (OHNM) to enhance our SCL approach. This technique complements our SCL method and enables us to control the number and complexity of negative samples, leading to further improvements in the model’s performance. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on two well-known benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness and rationality of our proposed SCL approach as compared to the state-of-the-art competitors.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3344634","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61802121); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China(grant numbers:2022JJ30159,2023JJ20013); China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:202206130103); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10378955","Graph reasoning;legal judgment prediction (LJP);supervised contrastive learning (SCL)","Task analysis;Law;Cognition;Topology;Learning systems;Network topology;Transformers","","","","57","IEEE","1 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Extracting structured relationships between entities in legal texts can significantly enhance our understanding of legal concepts and facilitate the creation of knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose a structured approach combining relation extraction, graph reasoning, and clustering methods to effectively extract and represent legal relationships. Firstly, we employ state-of-the-art relation extraction techniques to identify relevant entities and their relationships from unstructured legal documents. These techniques leverage natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to recognize entity pairs and assign appropriate relationship labels. Next, we leverage graph reasoning to enhance the extracted relationships by incorporating additional contextual information. By representing the legal entities and their relationships as nodes and edges in a knowledge graph, we can apply reasoning algorithms to infer implicit relationships, resolve conflicts, and expand the graph based on the legal domain’s rules and regulations. Furthermore, we integrate clustering methods to organize related legal entities and relationships into meaningful clusters within the knowledge graph. By grouping semantically similar entities and relationships, we can uncover patterns, identify common themes, and enable more effective retrieval and analysis of legal information. Our experiments demonstrate that the structured approach, combining relation extraction, graph reasoning, and clustering methods, effectively extracts and represents legal relationships in a knowledge graph. The resulting graph provides a comprehensive and organized representation of legal concepts, facilitating legal research, decision-making, and knowledge discovery in the legal domain.","","979-8-3503-0525-8","10.1109/GCAT59970.2023.10353444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10353444","Relation extraction;Knowledge graph creation;Legal documents;Graph reasoning;Clustering methods;Natural language processing;Machine learning","Machine learning algorithms;Law;Clustering methods;Decision making;Knowledge graphs;Cognition;Natural language processing","","1","","23","IEEE","19 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing works analyze the scaling law of epidemic protocol based on the assumption that each node has the same infectivity. Whereas, the most recent work indicates that the distribution of infected nodes has spatial-temporal correlation rather than homogeneity, i.e., nodes in different locations have different infectivities, which leads to defectiveness of the existing solutions. In this paper, by exploring the reason behind this difference, we try to relax the assumption and rebuild the model for epidemic routing. We first introduce the concept of infection rate to reflect the infectivity of infected nodes. Second, we propose an effective method to compute the average infection rate and use it to derive a generic scaling law. Third, we give an explicit expression for the generic scaling law, which provides us with upper bound. We finally compare our model with the existing works through theoretical analysis and simulations. The results show that our model has a closer match than those of the existing works and gets some insights into the spatial distribution of infection process.","1558-2612","978-1-4673-0437-5","10.1109/WCNC.2012.6214305","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6214305","Scaling law;Epidemic protocol;Infection rate;Delay tolerant networks","Routing;Mathematical model;Simulation;Analytical models;Distribution functions;Protocols;Computational modeling","","3","","15","IEEE","11 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Moreover, the result of term of penalty is closely related to the seriousness of the circumstance. However, existing research fails to model the impact of the seriousness of the circumstance on term of penalty. To address these problems, we present a sequential multi-task learning framework with task Dependencies and label Constraints for Legal Judgment Prediction (DCLJP). The DCLJP captures the multi-task dependency by the prediction forward-propagate mechanism over a directed acyclic graph and designs a novel loss function for obtaining the constraint relationships between the multi-task labels. In addition, we further adopt a reasoning method based on first-order predicate logic. It can drive the model to pay more attention to the correct term of penalty corresponding to the seriousness of the circumstance.

Achieving the required time to market with economically acceptable yield levels and maintaining them in volume production has become a daunting task in the most advanced technology nodes. One of the primary reasons is the relative increase in process variability in each generation. In the older technology generations, manufacturing yield loss was dominated by random defects. This situation started to change rapidly at the 130 nm technology node in which product layout systematic effects became more critical. More recently, due to challenging product performance requirements and increased process variability, parametric yield losses have become significant as well.","2156-017X","978-1-4244-2377-4","10.1109/IEDM.2008.4796711","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796711","","Moore's Law;Peer to peer computing;Costs;Circuits;Design methodology;Design optimization;Process design;MOS devices;Logic;Time to market","","2","","","IEEE","27 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It arises from perceptions or prejudices about the characteristics of a group, or the roles individuals should play in society. This bias can significantly impact the reasoning or outcomes of legal processes, such as judicial rulings. To ensure equal treatment for all individuals, it is crucial to effectively reduce this bias. The first step to reduce bias is to define approaches that can identify manifestations of gender bias. However, these manifestations are not usually easily detectable in text (e.g., through keywords) as they often require detailed contextual analysis, typically done manually by experts. This paper addresses this issue by leveraging natural language processing and machine learning techniques to automate parts of the analysis. Specifically, it proposes a processing pipeline based on text embeddings, binary classification, and the use of large language models (LLMs) to explain classification results. An initial evaluation on a set of judicial rulings shows promising results in terms of precision and recall, along with qualitative insights into the potential of these techniques in the legal domain.","2771-5752","979-8-3315-4097-5","10.1109/CLEI64178.2024.10700116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10700116","Natural Language Processing;Text Classification;Judicial Rulings;Gender bias;LLMs","Law;Large language models;Pipelines;Machine learning;Natural language processing;Cognition","","","","0","IEEE","8 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The manufacturing process of ETS used an electrolytic copper plating method to form copper foil pattern coated on carrier board, and then multi-layers of ETS structure will duplicate the same process flow to been made, such as laser via drill, electro-less copper plating, dry-film lamination, exposure and development, next layer plating of copper pattern, stripping after removing carrier board, micro etching to enhance adhesion with solder mask, and metal treatment of surface finish after process of solder mask opening. Different to traditional build-up process, the trace width of ETS structure would not be attacked during process of micro etching, and the wall structure formed by dry-film between traces can prevent solder bridge problem of copper pillar bump during process of flip chip bond (FCB) [1]. Manufacturing process of ETS must go through a sequential high-temperature and -pressure step, thus the approach to construct a complex and detailed model is so far engineer's objective for accurate prediction. When the assumption of stress-free at single curing temperature even though the chemical shrinkage has be considered is challenged, manufacturing temperature-independent model could not match well with experimental measurements because they don't include an integrated processing modeling methodology. In particular, temperature-dependent material properties and different stress-free temperatures for different materials in the same model were considered in order to model the sequential steps during the sequential fabrication of high-density electronic packaging structures. However, the effort on fundamental study usually makes an impossible work due to time-and manpower-consuming, thus the mission has been transferred to construct an effective and simple approach on thermo-mechanical analysis. In this study, the material modeling has been simply constructed on elastically temperature-dependence for polymeric material utilized in packaging extensively. Furthermore, the innovative concept of conservation laws also has been developed on stress constitutive model; meanwhile, the creative ideology, such as cross-linking induced residual strain (εRS) from compound forming and process-induced stress field, further has been embedded. Others, the experimental vehicles also have been performed for a reasonable simplification at single stress-free temperature of substrate, besides measurements were scheduled to confirm the accuracy on warpage. As comparison, these two different warpage modeling methodologies, including processing model and non-processing model, of an encapsulated integrated circuit (IC) package, associated with different schemes of a sequential manufacturing process, were analyzed. The results indicate if elastically stress constitutive model is: (1) constructed on stress conservation law with temperature-dependent property; (2) considered at single stress-free temperature respectively for compound and substrate; and (3) involved the effect of residual strain from compound forming, the numerical solutions were agreed well with measured data. Finally, the capability to save computation for effective material property of laminated substrate has been tested and indicated that material property in in-plane direction can be treated as homogeneous by rule of mixture, especially for temperature below the glass transition temperature (Tg) of PP.","","978-1-5386-7668-4","10.1109/EPTC.2018.8654292","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8654292","ETS;thermo-mechanical analysis;elastically temperature-dependence;conservation laws;residual strain;single stress-free temperature of substrate","Strain;Stress;Temperature measurement;Substrates;Copper;Integrated circuit modeling;Lamination","","","","11","IEEE","28 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, these technologies remain in their early stages and face challenges such as understanding complex legal reasoning, managing biased data, ensuring transparency, and avoiding misleading responses, commonly referred to as hallucinations. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Legal Query RAG (LQ-RAG), a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework with a recursive feedback mechanism specifically designed to overcome the critical shortcomings of standard RAG implementations in legal applications. The proposed framework incorporates four key components: a custom evaluation agent, a specialized response generation model, a prompt engineering agent, and a fine-tuned legal embedding LLM. Together, these components effectively minimize hallucinations, improve domain-specific accuracy, and deliver precise, high-quality responses for complex queries. Experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned embedding LLM achieves a 13% improvement in Hit Rate and a 15% improvement in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). Comparisons with general LLMs reveal a 24% performance gain when using the Hybrid Fine-Tuned Generative LLM (HFM), the specialized response generation model integrated into the LQ-RAG framework. Furthermore, LQ-RAG achieves a 23% improvement in relevance score over naive configurations and a 14% improvement over RAG with Fine-Tuned LLMs (FTM). These findings underscore the potential of domain-specific fine-tuned LLMs, combined with advanced RAG modules and feedback mechanisms, to significantly enhance the reliability and performance of AI in legal practice. The reliance of this study on a proprietary model as the evaluation agent, combined with the lack of feedback from human experts, highlights the need for improvement. Future efforts should focus on developing a specialized legal evaluation agent and enhancing its performance by incorporating feedback from domain experts.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3542125","Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP); Korea Government (MSIT) (IITP-2025-RS-2021-II210118, Development of decentralized consensus composition technology for large-scale nodes); IITP (Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation)-ITRC (Information Technology Research Center); Korea Government [Ministry of Science and Information and Communication Technology (ICT)](grant numbers:IITP-2025-RS-2021-II211835); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10887211","Retrieval-augmented generation;legal query;LLM agent;information retrieval","Law;Retrieval augmented generation;Accuracy;Tuning;Semantics;Hybrid power systems;Adaptation models;Training;Reliability;Mathematical models","","","","63","CCBY","14 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To assist in this problem, we propose LegalVis, a web-based visual analytics system designed to support the analysis of legal documents that cite or could potentially cite a BP. We model the problem of identifying potential citations (i.e., non-explicit) as a classification problem. However, a simple score is not enough to explain the results; that is why we use an interpretability machine learning method to explain the reason behind each identified citation. For a compelling visual exploration of documents and BPs, LegalVis comprises three interactive visual components: the first presents an overview of the data showing temporal patterns, the second allows filtering and grouping relevant documents by topic, and the last one shows a document’s text aiming to interpret the model’s output by pointing out which paragraphs are likely to mention the BP, even if not explicitly specified.

A conservative dynamic performance of this class of switched systems under switching is presented, which is the possible maximum value of the system dynamic output maximum percent overshoot at any different switching points. The conservative dynamic performance is dependent just on the system parameters but not on the initial states caused by different switching points, which makes it easy to present an exact performance objective in switching control design.

Allocating reasonable attention to these elements related to the penalty is the key to improving the effect of the penalty prediction. To this end, we propose a novel model called MHA-AR which learns to focus on the key elements by a modulated hierarchical attention mechanism and a legal attribute recognition subtask. Besides benefiting the prediction accuracy, it also improves the reliability and credibility of predictions for users by providing comprehensible legal attributes related to the penalty. A series of experiments conducted on the real-world datasets demonstrate the correctness of our assumptions and the superiority of MHA-AR.

In addition, it is costly to maintain an up-to-date database as legal knowledge is constantly being updated. To address these issues, we propose the Generation-based Method for Legal Question Answering (GLQA). GLQA instead models LQA as a generation task to flexibly produce new relevant answers specific to each question. To further make the answers more controllable and informative, GLQA incorporates laws as external knowledge into the answer generation process. Specifically, our method contains a retriever and a generator. The retriever is used to retrieve applicable law articles as external knowledge and the generator aims to generate answers with the help of external knowledge. The retriever and the generator are integrated into a single T5 model using multi-task learning to make them mutually reinforcing. Our design enables the model not only to produce highly relevant new answers but also to keep the knowledge in the answers up-to-date by modifying the law database at a low cost.","2161-4407","978-1-6654-8867-9","10.1109/IJCNN54540.2023.10191483","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10191483","Legal question answering;Knowledge-enhanced text generation;Multi-task learning;Sentence embeddings","Costs;Law;Databases;Neural networks;Process control;Multitasking;Question answering (information retrieval)","","1","","39","IEEE","2 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It can provide wider range of spectra to describe the random rough surfaces than other spectra. Based on the proposed spectrum, backscattering of soil surfaces is studied by using the integral equation model (IEM). The simulation results are compared with the experimental measurements of real soil surfaces at L, C, and X bands for the different roughness scales and moisture conditions.

Whilst we focus upon legal principles for decision making in discretionary legal domains, our goal is to develop theory for constructing legal decision support systems.

Most warehouses arrange routes for circulation along the shelves, transportation vehicles will move on this road to perform the task of exporting or importing goods. Routes will be arranged to move in one direction because vehicles do not have enough space to turn around in cramped warehouses. This causes many difficulties in planning the trajectory for transportation vehicles, especially self-propelled vehicles. In order to have an appropriate transportation plan, it is necessary to solve many problems, including: reasonable transport equipment, sufficient number of devices, optimal route layout, algorithm of operation center for Positioning and Navigation of transportation equipment. This study proposes a method for transportation using an omnidirectional automated guided vehicle (AGV). The AGV's omnidirectional mobility is supported by the mecanum wheels, so vehicles can move in multiple directions on the road without turning, even at a junction or an intersection. This study consists of two parts, the first part focuses on kinematic modeling for mecanum wheels and extends to robot’s platform using four mecanum wheels. Part two proposes a diagram to calculate the errors of the robot compared to a reference tracking line, design a control law based on the Lyapunov stability criterion. The stability of the control law is verified and confirmed by simulation on Matlab environment.","","979-8-3503-1548-6","10.1109/ISEE59483.2023.10299844","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10299844","Mecanum Wheels;Omni – directional Mobile Platform;Lyapunov Stability;Line Tracking Robots;AGV","Roads;Stability criteria;Transportation;Wheels;Kinematics;Robot sensing systems;Turning","","","","17","IEEE","2 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, interest in the Barkhausen effect has grown as it is a good example of dynamical critical scaling behavior, evidenced by experimental observation of a power law distribution of the Barkhausen jump size. So far, most experimental studies have been carried out on bulk samples using a classical inductive technique, which is difficult to apply to thin film samples mainly due to the low signal intensity. For this reason, very few experiments have been done on two-dimensional ferromagnetic thin films. In this talk, I will report direct domain observations of Barkhausen avalanches at criticality in Co and MnAs nanothin films investigated by means of a magnetooptical microscope magnetometer, capable of time-resolved domain observation in real time. Through a statistical analysis of the fluctuating size of Barkhausen jump from numerous repetitive experiments for each sample, the distribution of Barkhausen jump size is found to exhibit a power-law scaling behavior with the critical exponent τ ∼ 1.33 for all samples having different thickness from 5 to 50 nm. The most striking feature is the fact that the τ values are in the same universality class for all samples within the measurement error despite of the difference in the film thickness. This result implies an invariance of the critical exponent τ irrespective of the number of defects in the thin films. Our experimental results directly verify the CZDS model, where the model describes 180°-type flexible domain wall deformed by localized defects with consideration of long-range dipolar interaction.","","0-7695-2189-4","10.1109/ICMENS.2004.1508927","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1508927","","Transistors;Magnetic materials;Deformable models;Physics;Nanostructured materials;Magnetoelectronics;Materials science and technology;Magnetization;Magnetooptic effects;Magnetic force microscopy","","","","6","IEEE","19 Sep 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The obtained findings reveal that the proposed model can well describe the non-uniform distribution of moisture inside the OIP bushing capacitor core.","","978-1-83953-605-2","10.1049/icp.2022.0440","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9800409","","","","1","","","","20 Jun 2022","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Legal reasoning is more multifaceted in distinguishing fields to make fair and accurate decisions. To normalize legal reasoning route appropriately it requires analysis and expertness. Similarly, to automate the complex legal reasoning, it is required an expert system. In this paper, we propose an expert system model in the area of acquisition of immovable property such as tangible property (land or house etc...). The contexts to be performed in legal reasoning in this domain are (i) to acquire immovable property (ii) to transfer immovable property (iii) to mortgage immovable property (iv)to gifting immovable property. We propose empirical approach with the help of integrating rule based technique along with case based reasoning and building hybrid system by involving interpreting constitutions, statutes, and regulations in balancing fundamental principles to make ultimate decisions. Our model is an interactive that it allows the end users to answer with respect to questions asked by the interactive legal expert system as a result system which is helpful to legal decision advisory system or system for classification of facts or fact finding diagnostic system.","","978-1-4799-3486-7","10.1109/CNSC.2014.6906664","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6906664","Expert System;Legal Reasoning;Immovable Property;Legal Rules;Decision Making;VisiRule","Law;Cognition;Expert systems;Agriculture;Decision making","","7","","13","IEEE","25 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unrestricted legal advice, such as attorney-client communication or litigation strategy, is exempt from disclosure in litigation or regulatory events and is vital to the attorney-client relationship. To protect this information from disclosure, companies and outside counsel must review vast amounts of documents to determine those that contain privileged material. This process is costly and time consuming. As data volumes increase, legal counsel employs methods to reduce the number of documents requiring review while balancing the need to ensure the protection of privileged information. Keyword searching is a popular method to target privileged information and reduce document review populations. Keyword terms are effective at casting a wide net but generally return overly inclusive results – most of which do not contain privileged information. To overcome the weaknesses of keyword searching, legal teams have started using supervised learning techniques to more precisely target privileged information. However, reviewing and labeling training documents is costly and time intensive and may cause counsel to forego the use of supervised learning in certain scenarios. In addition, supervised learning techniques may not find all the privileged documents in a document review and require companies to use keyword terms to identify critical privileged information. In this paper, the authors propose a novel method to automatically identify privileged documents without the need to label new training documents. This method integrates rule-based reasoning with transfer learning. Experimental results show that the proposed integrated method performs better than rule-based reasoning and transfer learning individually and can effectively identify privileged documents.","","978-1-6654-8045-1","10.1109/BigData55660.2022.10020392","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10020392","Text classification;Rule-based reasoning;Transfer learning;E-Discovery;ediscovery;Legal document review","Training;Law;Transfer learning;Supervised learning;Keyword search;Text categorization;Companies","","2","","7","IEEE","26 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The ultimate goal is to support legal decision-making with automation. The legal domain is a challenging one to tackle. However, current advances in analytic technologies and models hold the promise of success. Our application of Hadoop MapReduce in conjunction with a number of algorithms, such as clustering, classification, word count, word co-occurrence, and row similarity, is encouraging, in that the results are robust enough to suggest these approaches have promise and are worth pursuing. By utilizing larger case data sets and sample sizes and by using deep machine learning models in text analytics, more breakthroughs can be achieved to provide decision support to the legal domain.

However, most of the existing work does not distinguish circumstances in law articles, and uses the entire law article as a whole. In order to make finer-grained reasoning, we consider law articles at circumstance level. As descriptions of circumstances may depend on some other circumstances, we construct a circumstance-based law article graph (CLAG) reflecting the dependencies between circumstances in order to create better representations for them.

This paper presents an in-depth study of Brooks' law using the system dynamics simulation approach. Unlike the first-order approximation of Brooks' law, we found some interesting results that can benefit practicing project managers. We found that adding people to a late project will always increase its cost, but the project may not always be late. Only under a certain degree of sequential constraints among the project tasks will the project be delayed. To investigate the impact of sequential constraints, we simulated numerous task conditions and found that there is a time-line T for each project which means that, if enough manpower is added before T, the project still can finish before the scheduled deadline. If the manpower adjustment is after T, then the project will definitely be late. In this way, Brooks' law is revised and turned into a useful guiding principle to benefit software development.","0730-3157","0-7695-0368-3","10.1109/CMPSAC.1999.814310","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=814310","","Electrical capacitance tomography;Delay;Scheduling;Costs;Programming;Postal services;Financial management;Software development management;Technology management;System testing","","7","","6","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to decrease the number of erroneous regulations, this study uses a priori knowledge that biochemical networks exhibit hierarchical structures. This study detects the hierarchical structure in the target network using a hierarchical random graph model proposed by Clauset and colleagues. When the regulations inferred by the inference method are inconsistent with the detected hierarchical structure, we can conclude that they are unreasonable. However, it is not always easy to detect the hierarchical structure in the target network because of the regulations erroneously inferred by the inference method. In order to obtain a reasonable hierarchical structure, this study first infers a large number of genetic networks from the observed gene expression data by using a method that combines a genetic network inference method with a bootstrap method. We then extract a hierarchical structure from the inferred multiple genetic networks so that it is consistent with most of the networks. Through numerical experiments, we finally show that the use of the hierarchical structure in the network improves the reliabilities of regulations inferred by the genetic network inference method.","2161-4407","978-1-4799-1960-4","10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280362","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280362","","Reliability;Periodic structures;Search problems;Genetics;Time measurement","","","","15","IEEE","1 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study has been conducted for two reasons-to answer the question `Can criminal tendency be detected from web activities?' and to contribute to technical developments in computer forensics. Criminal records for conventional and cybercrimes committed in Turkey, detection of criminals, the sentences given, and the methods used have been examined. The technical developments in the literature dealing with web forensics have been investigated and emphasis has been laid on the types of crimes to be handled in order to develop new models. The process, method, technique, application and software of the web forensics procedure, which handles web activities, have been investigated. We observed that problems are encountered mainly at the stage of evidence analysis. The crime models that were analyzed in the legal department were determined in order to create a database for new models in the technical field.","","978-1-7281-2827-6","10.1109/ISDFS.2019.8757536","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8757536","web forensics;information technology law","Browsers;Forensics;Criminal law;Internet;Computer crime","","1","","14","IEEE","11 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Cyber law and espionage law as communicating vessels","A. Lubin","Post-Doctoral Cyber Research Fellow, Tufts University, Medford, MA, United States","2018 10th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (CyCon)","9 Jul 2018","2018","","","203","226","Existing legal literature would have us assume that espionage operations and ""below-the-threshold"" cyber operations are doctrinally distinct. Whereas one is subject to the scant, amorphous, and under-developed legal framework of espionage law, the other is subject to an emerging, ever-evolving body of legal rules, known cumulatively as cyber law. This dichotomy, however, is erroneous and misleading. In practice, espionage and cyber law function as communicating vessels, and so are better conceived as two elements of a complex system, Information Warfare (IW). This paper therefore first draws attention to the similarities between the practices - the fact that the actors, technologies, and targets are interchangeable, as are the knee-jerk legal reactions of the international community. In light of the convergence between peacetime Low-Intensity Cyber Operations (LICOs) and peacetime Espionage Operations (EOs) the two should be subjected to a single regulatory framework, one which recognizes the role intelligence plays in our public world order and which adopts a contextual and consequential method of inquiry. The paper proceeds in the following order: Part 2 provides a descriptive account of the unique symbiotic relationship between espionage and cyber law, and further explains the reasons for this dynamic. Part 3 places the discussion surrounding this relationship within the broader discourse on IW, making the claim that the convergence between EOs and LICOs, as described in Part 2, could further be explained by an even larger convergence across all the various elements of the informational environment. Parts 2 and 3 then serve as the backdrop for Part 4, which details the attempt of the drafters of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 to compartmentalize espionage law and cyber law, and the deficits of their approach. The paper concludes by proposing an alternative holistic understanding of espionage law, grounded in general principles of law, which is more practically transferable to the cyber realm.","2325-5374","978-9-9499-9043-6","10.23919/CYCON.2018.8405018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8405018","international law;information warfare;espionage;cyber law;Tallinn Manual 2.0;sovereignty;diplomatic law;consular law;general principles of law","Law;Convergence;Manuals;Malware;Cyberattack;IP networks","","5","","","","9 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our theory was modified several times to try different clustering methods, k-means methods, hierarchical clusters, etc. All these techniques were used to achieve the goals of detecting hidden connections and trends in a group of legal entities – types of violations, types of outcomes of a legal dispute. One of our main conclusions is that it is possible to use clustering as a tool to assess higher-risk entities and their violation tendencies in regulatory compliance rules. Clustering analyses conducted previously also suggest that clustering and its related techniques can be of value to legal practitioners, legislators, and auditors in devising remedial intervention strategies to curb all forms of corporate law violations.

The advantages of the energy-efficient building are the decreasing energy consumption and operation costs, the usage of green energy solutions and the comfort. The appearing of the energy-efficient buildings can be traced back to the increasing energy price, the conscious usage of sustainable energy and the progress in software technology. The building should meet the demands of the certificate - although different regulations claim different regards - to achieve the eligible energy performance assessment. The sufficient accomplishments can be achieved through the aspects of energetic or building automation. This paper aims to focus on the investigation and comparison of these energy performance assessments for newly built or renovated buildings.

Despite recent advances in information extraction (IE) techniques, no suitable automated methods can be applied to constructing a domain-specific, comprehensive, and high-quality knowledge graph. However, a semi-automatic strategy, which can ensure the basic quality requirements of a knowledge graph, has been successfully implemented in the elementary science domain. This paper presents a semantic annotation system developed for building a high-quality legal knowledge graph (SALKG) using the semi-automatic strategy. We introduce its system design, architecture, algorithms, functions, and implementation. To investigate the effectiveness of SALKG, we conduct a preliminary annotation experiment with 280 legal texts which were collected from the Harvard Caselaw Access Project. The user evaluation from 32 graduate students demonstrates the high usability of SALKG in semantic annotation and the potential for building a high-quality legal knowledge graph.

"Assessing GPT's Legal Knowledge in Japanese Real Estate Transactions Exam","K. Inoshita","Faculty of Data Science, Shiga University, Hikone, Japan","2024 International Conference on Innovation and Intelligence for Informatics, Computing, and Technologies (3ICT)","13 Jan 2025","2024","","","149","155","In recent years, large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, developed by OpenAI, have demonstrated impressive capabilities in tasks such as natural language understanding, code generation, and even passing professional exams. Trained on vast datasets, these models have shown high accuracy across various fields. One challenging area for LLMs is professional certification exams, which require specialized knowledge and understanding of complex regulations. The Real Estate Transaction Specialist Examination (RETSE) in Japan is a key certification for professionals managing real estate transactions. Passing the RETSE qualifies individuals to handle legal responsibilities like ensuring the legality of property deals. The exam covers civil law, tax law, and real estate regulations, making it a comprehensive test of legal knowledge. With a pass rate of around 15%, it is considered one of Japan's more difficult professional exams, making it a strong benchmark for evaluating LLM performance. This study evaluates the ability of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to answer RETSE questions, comparing their performance to official passing criteria and analyzing the effect of prompt engineering. While GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5, neither model met the passing standard. Prompt strategies such as “Consider customary laws” improved response accuracy, especially for complex legal questions. These findings suggest that while GPT models cannot fully replace human expertise in legal exams like RETSE, they offer potential as supplementary learning tools for verifying basic knowledge. To mitigate the risk of job displacement by AI, it is crucial for professionals to enhance their expertise in areas where LLMs struggle, such as recent legal changes and ethical judgment. This study highlights both the limitations and potential of GPT in legal contexts, providing insights into how AI can support learners and practitioners in real estate law.","2770-7466","979-8-3315-3313-7","10.1109/3ict64318.2024.10824669","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10824669","GPT;Legal Knowledge Assessment;Real Estate Transactions;Prompt Engineering;AI in Education","Ethics;Technological innovation;Accuracy;Law;Large language models;Regulation;Natural language processing;Prompt engineering;Certification;Standards","","","","20","IEEE","13 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The chatbot is designed to offer precise legal guidance by extracting pertinent laws from the Sri Lankan constitution based on user input. Building on existing studies at the intersection of NLP and the legal domain, this chatbot addresses the lack of relevant legal context for Sri Lanka. Reinforcement learning is integrated to refine the chatbot’s behavior through user feedback, ensuring optimal selection of the most relevant laws. An exploration of applications in countries like Canada and India, where NLP and machine learning have successfully addressed legal information gaps, focuses on various legal domains in Sri Lanka with the aim of empowering the public. The research methodology involves leveraging the Sri Lankan constitution as the dataset, extracting keywords from legal documents, and employing various NLP models, and limitations of the application. A comprehensive literature review reveals the potential energy of NLP techniques in legal chatbots. The global analysis of legal chatbots significantly contributes to the theoretical foundation of this project. In summary, this project seeks to advance legal chatbot technology in Sri Lanka, utilizing NLP and reinforcement learning techniques to empower citizens with legal knowledge and enhance overall legal awareness, thereby addressing the critical issue of legal unawareness and fostering a more informed society.","","979-8-3315-0917-0","10.1109/SLAAI-ICAI63667.2024.10844946","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10844946","Natural Language Processing (NLP);Q-learning;Reinforcement Learning;Chatbot;Sri Lankan Constitution","Potential energy;Law;Buildings;Reinforcement learning;Chatbots;Mobile applications;Encryption;Security;IEEE Constitution;Systematic literature review","","","","16","IEEE","20 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The ability to predict a person’s facial appearance from a DNA sample may generate important investigative leads and provide an unprecedented advancement in criminal investigations. To achieve the above goal, it is first essential to substantiate, model and measure the intrinsic relationship between the genomic markers and phenotypic features. In the first step, we have standardized the 3D face scans using a widely used 3D data format - CoMA. The standardization was followed by its projection into a low-dimensional latent embedding space. The second step was to reduce the dimensionality of the genetic space. The dimensionality reduction was achieved by performing Principal Component Analysis on the genomic markers to generate compact genomic properties. A simple multi-layer perceptron was trained to classify an ensemble of facial embeddings and genomic properties into genuine and imposter pairings. The classification model could match the DNA with the given 3D face with an average Area Under the Curve score of 0.73. The introduction of hand-picked genomic markers was an important contribution toward improving the final AUC score. Furthermore, results indicated that incorporating additional phenotypical properties such as sex and age leads to better verification. Thus, this study represents an important milestone toward building a functional machine learning pipeline capable of predicting facial appearance and other visible traits from a DNA sample.","","978-1-6654-9402-1","10.1109/WI-IAT55865.2022.00114","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10102080","dimensionality reduction;spiral convolution;biometric verification;fusion network","Deep learning;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Pipelines;Genomics;DNA;Data models","","1","","14","IEEE","24 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Two case-based reasoning systems were developed (in CA-Clipper) which attempt to fulfil Ashley's criteria: CAMLAW (CAseMark LAW), for the retrieval of industrial law reports, and ICARUS (Intelligent CAse Retrieval Using Semantic Comparison). CAMLAW could be regarded as fulfilling Ashley's criteria. ICARUS, at its current stage of development has some problems. Something better than Roget's Thesaurus needs to be explored.

In the present vehicle conditions, various vehicles are out and about, run by the driver who doesn't hold any legitimate permit(driving license), despite the fact that it is difficult to get the drivers license. Accordingly a framework can be created which will act to control these issues, prior to starting the vehicle, by making certain safety efforts. The vehicle should start provided that the genuine driving permit holder is driving that specific vehicle else the vehicle won't start, by this way we can getentrance over the non driving permit holders to drive the vehicle and stay away from frightful traffic circumstances. This can be done by using a Face Recognition Module installed inside the vehicle.

By empirical analysis on the Chinese listed companies which conducted equity transfer in A-share markets of Shanghai and Shenzhen during 2000-2005, this article draws the conclusion that the perfection of legislation can effectively restrict controlling shareholders' expropriation. The stronger the application of law enforcement, the higher the controlling shareholders' violating standard to the investors' interests. The reason may be that although the whole legislation environment was improving during 2000-2005, yet the legislation shortage in some specific areas resulted in the increase of law enforcement cost, and eventually got little effect with improving law enforcement.

Pavani","NA; NA; NA; NA; NA","Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2004","347","3","824","832","In this paper we discuss the reason why the parameters of the Sérsic model best-fitting the major axis light profile of elliptical galaxies can differ significantly from those derived for the minor axis profile. We show that this discrepancy is a natural consequence of the fact that the isophote eccentricity varies with the radius of the isophote and present a mathematical transformation that allows the minor axis Sérsic model to be calculated from the major axis model, provided that the elliptical isophotes are aligned and concentric and that their eccentricity can be represented by a well behaved, though quite general, function of the radius. When there is no variation in eccentricity only the effective radius changes in the Sérsic model, while for radial-dependent eccentricity the transformation, which allows the minor axis Sérsic model to be calculated from the major axis model is given by the Lerch Φ transcendental function. The proposed transformation was tested using photometric data for 28 early-type galaxies.","1365-2966","","10.1111/j.1365-2966.2004.07254.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8161803","galaxies: fundamental parameters;galaxies: photometry;galaxies: structure","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Baigent","London, UK; London, UK","IEEE International Engineering Management Conference","10 Dec 2002","2002","2","","837","841 vol.2","The value attached to intellectual property, particularly patents, has been rapidly increasing. The recognition, development and exploitation of intellectual property is now a central factor in technology management. However, in the field of electronics in particular, there is a natural tension between two objectives: on the one hand, protecting market share by carving out clear proprietary positions; and, on the other hand, growing the market through industry-wide acceptance for new technologies, particularly by having the technology accepted as standard. The general requirement imposed on companies that participate in formal standards-setting is that they must give an undertaking to the standards body to offer licences to essential intellectual property on terms that are fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory. Any patentee that has been involved in standards-setting, and which later seeks to license or litigate related patent rights, inevitably faces arguments about this requirement. The position is further complicated by the international legal landscape. In the European Union, it is often argued by potential infringers that the patented technology is an ""essential facility"", access to which (it is argued) must be granted under EU competition law. Patentees, however, view this as a form of compulsory licensing. There is much that the technology manager can do to plan a successful route, guiding the development of technology projects through the complex interrelated network of law, business practice, and technology. It is important to plan technical developments so as to create a balanced portfolio of essential and nonessential rights, framed around appropriate products and methods, and to ensure that third party use of the rights can be effectively controlled and policed in a manner that benefits the technology and the business.","","0-7803-7385-5","10.1109/IEMC.2002.1038547","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1038547","","Intellectual property;Navigation;Law;Technology management;Licenses;Consumer electronics;Industrial electronics;Protection;Electronics industry;Standards organizations","","","","","IEEE","10 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

After obtaining good consistency with the experimental results, the diffusion law of the warm drainage with the change of the environmental flow velocity was obtained by changing the ocean current velocity. Finally, a partial design was carried out at the bottom of the ship: a baffle was added between the water outlet and the water inlet. Two parameters of the baffle are determined: position and height.

As a first stage to addressing this problem, this paper proposes a framework for a tool suite designed to partially automate the acquisition and management of static system visualization in a feedback loop with dynamic execution properties. This model enables developers to find a best fit system configuration, potentially reconciling resource contention and utilization tensions that are critical to multi-core platforms.

This article discusses the ""doctrine of equivalents,"" which allows the patent holder to expand a patent beyond its literal terms to cover subject matter it doesn't expressly mention. At its heart are two premises: first, it is difficult to capture the full scope of technical innovation in words; and second, some people are wiseguys. No matter how carefully a patent claim is worded, no matter how well it appears to cover an invention, there will always be those who will search eagerly for the loophole, a way to circumvent language and avoid infringement. Patent law rewards innovation with exclusivity for a limited time period. But the reason patents are printed and published is to encourage still further innovation. The problem arises when someone slyly avoids a patent's language without contributing anything new-in effect, appropriating the benefits of an invention without enriching the art. Ultimately, the doctrine of equivalents plays a marginal role in patent law. That's because reasonably well-written patent claims are not, in the main, easy to avoid if the benefits of the invention are to be retained. Courts apply the doctrine to catch the occasional wiseguy while defending the certainty patent claims are supposed to provide. The Supreme Courts latest adjustment notwithstanding, that role is likely to continue.","1939-9340","","10.1109/MSPEC.2002.1015437","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1015437","","Patents;Legal factors","","","","","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

Here we review Benford's distribution for continuous random variables under scale invariance. The implausibility of strict scale invariance leads us to a generalisation of Benford's distribution based on Pareto variables. This new model is more realistic, because real datasets are more prone to complying with a relaxed, rather than strict, definition of scale invariance. We also argue against forensic detection tests based on the distribution of the most significant digit. To show the arbitrariness of these tests, we give discrete distributions of the first coefficient of a continued fraction which hold in the exact same conditions as Benford's distribution and its generalisation.","2076-1465","978-9-0827-9706-0","10.23919/EUSIPCO54536.2021.9616057","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9616057","Benford's law;Pareto distribution;forensics;continued fractions","Forensics;Europe;Signal processing;Random variables","","1","","18","","8 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In a three-month prototype application in a small metropolitan area, the system demonstrated a traffic violation detection rate of 92.3% - including speeding and red-light running - with a reduction of false positives compared to traditional methods of 28%. Upon putting the system to use, releases in traffic violations were cut by 30%, and the punctuality of the traffic flow during rush hour was given a 15% boost with evidence of the reduction of average waiting time at major junctions. Furthermore, it enhanced the response time via technology, with responders achieving an 18% cut in the average response time of emergency vehicles compared to the original method. Nevertheless, some problems were observed: first, high dependence on the Internet - the data processing of objectives was slowed down by 12% of regions with a weak Internet connection. In addition, 14 % of users reported concerns about data privacy, showing the necessity of taking steps to improve data protection.

The strength of partial discharge and the formation of soil discharge channels are closely related to the magnitude of the critical breakdown field strength. Therefore, how to accurately obtain the variation law of the critical breakdown field strength of typical soil is the key to realize the safe operation of the grounding device and the cable in the ground and ensure the safety of personnel and equipment. In this paper, a simulation experiment of soil impact characteristics is used to study the variation law of typical soil critical breakdown field strength with soil properties. X-ray transmission imaging technology is used to obtain the morphology of the discharge channel, and its non-intrusive observation method will not disturb the discharge channel itself, making the measurement more accurate. This paper first selects a variety of typical soils to study the influence of soil moisture, salt content, compactness and other factors on the discharge channel morphology, and then studies the calculation method of the critical breakdown field strength of the soil under different discharge channel morphologies. And further explore the reasons for the influence of typical soil media factors on the critical breakdown field strength. The experimental results show that under the same conditions, the relationship between the critical breakdown field strength values of different soils is: Ec of sandy soil <; Ec of loam soil <; Ec of pastoral soil; It is precisely because of the different reasons that different factors of the soil medium affect the critical breakdown field strength, the content of water and air inside the soil and the conductivity of the soil are different, so that the variation law of the critical breakdown field strength is different.","2474-3852","978-1-7281-5511-1","10.1109/ICHVE49031.2020.9279579","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9279579","Discharge channel morphology;critical breakdown field strength;X-ray imaging technology","Soil;Electric breakdown;Discharges (electric);X-ray imaging;Electrodes;Morphology;Conductivity","","","","10","IEEE","15 Dec 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The existing methods did not fully use representation-based and interaction-based text matching in the feature extraction. This paper presents an innovative approach that employs ensemble learning with multiple models to enhance the prediction of legal case similarity. The method comprises two sub-networks: a similarity representation sub-network and a binary classification judgment sub-network. The similarity representation sub-network is trained using contrastive learning, focusing on semanticizing the similarity between sample features to distinguish between dissimilar samples and reduce the distance between similar ones. Furthermore, the binary classification judgment sub-network integrates sample pairs to facilitate feature interaction between text pairs during extraction. The training of these two sub-networks employs different information processing and optimization loss, which allows ensemble learning to capitalize on the strengths of both models and significantly improve the accuracy of predicting the similarity of legal cases.

"A general model for the CO–H2 conversion factor in galaxies with applications to the star formation law","D. Narayanan; M. R. Krumholz; E. C. Ostriker; L. Hernquist","NA; NA; NA; NA","Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society","19 Jan 2018","2012","421","4","3127","3146","The most common means of converting an observed CO line intensity into a molecular gas mass requires the use of a conversion factor (XCO). While in the Milky Way this quantity does not appear to vary significantly, there is good reason to believe that XCO will depend on the larger‐scale galactic environment. With sensitive instruments pushing detections to increasingly high redshift, characterizing XCO as a function of physical conditions is crucial to our understanding of galaxy evolution. Utilizing numerical models, we investigate how varying metallicities, gas temperatures and velocity dispersions in galaxies impacts the way CO line emission traces the underlying H2 gas mass, and under what circumstances XCO may differ from the Galactic mean value. We find that, due to the combined effects of increased gas temperature and velocity dispersion, XCO is depressed below the Galactic mean in high surface density environments such as ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). In contrast, in low‐metallicity environments, XCO tends to be higher than in the Milky Way, due to photodissociation of CO in metal‐poor clouds. At higher redshifts, gas‐rich discs may have gravitationally unstable clumps that are warm (due to increased star formation) and have elevated velocity dispersions. These discs tend to have XCO values ranging between present‐epoch gas‐rich mergers and quiescent discs at low z. This model shows that on average mergers do have lower XCO values than disc galaxies, though there is significant overlap. XCO varies smoothly with the local conditions within a galaxy, and is not a function of global galaxy morphology. We combine our results to provide a general fitting formula for XCO as a function of CO line intensity and metallicity. We show that replacing the traditional approach of using one constant XCO for starbursts and another for discs with our best‐fitting function produces star formation laws that are continuous rather than bimodal, and that have significantly reduced scatter.","1365-2966","","10.1111/j.1365-2966.2012.20536.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8174333","ISM: clouds;ISM: molecules;galaxies: interactions;galaxies: ISM;galaxies: starburst;galaxies: star formation","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Plasma particles penetrate the ablating gas-plasma cloud to the evaporating pellet surface and deliver power to the cloud to drive its expansion. The evaporation rate is determined by a ""self-regulating"" mechanism. The ablation time is shown to be proportional to a5/3λo-2/3Γo-1/3 where a is the pellet radius, λo is the effective penetration depth of the incident particle into solid hydrogen and Γo is the power flux density of the incident particles. It is found that for ablation in a thermonuclear plasma, the alpha particles significantly affect the ablation rate. For thermonuclear plasma electrons and alpha particles, the energy required to ablate one molecule is shown to be of the order of 10 eV or less. The scaling law is applied to presently available experimental results, and reasonable agreement is found.","1939-9375","","10.1109/TPS.1977.4316997","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4316997","","Hydrogen;Plasma density;Alpha particles;Electrons;Space charge;Clouds;Plasma properties;Plasma temperature;Solids;Plasma accelerators","","20","","16","IEEE","12 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, in the work, instead of linearizing the sensations of the quantization scale of a television signal, it is proposed to optimize the choice of code combinations for image transmission. This approach can be effective in television systems without compression of video information with losses, for example, for transmitting signals over short distances or in channels for transmitting signals of the image of Earth remote sensing systems.","","978-1-7281-0606-9","10.1109/SOSG.2019.8706774","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8706774","Weber-Fechner law;gamma correction;transfer characteristic;efficient coding;risk matrix;probability matrix","Quantization (signal);TV;Image communication;Brightness;Visualization;Distortion;Informatics","","10","","19","IEEE","6 May 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Various existing force control schemes are investigated and the reasons for discarding them are given. Then, the emphasis is put on a so-called external force control scheme, which seems to be a solution to our problem. The control law appearing in such a scheme is determined by means of a realistic robot simulator developed on a SUN workstation. A simple integral term on the force error gives acceptable results in various robot configurations.

The relevance of research. The authors of the article note that modern education in Russia and internationally is undergoing significant changes due to the active introduction of artificial intelligence into human life. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a way to make a computer—controlled robot or program capable of thinking as intelligently as a person. The basis for the creation of artificial intelligence are the following sciences and technologies: computer science, biology, psychology, linguistics.. The novelty of the research lies in determining the main directions of transformation of the educational process at the university in the conditions of cybersocialization of society. The purpose of the study is to identify the possibilities and problems of using artificial intelligence in the educational process and jurisprudence. The main tasks that need to be solved in this work: 1. To understand the reasons for the creation of artificial intelligence and the possibilities of its application in education and law at the present stage of development of society; 2. To explore possible areas of application of artificial intelligence technologies in the educational process; 3. To reveal the prospects of using artificial intelligence in teaching students and schoolchildren; 4. Evaluate the pros and cons of using artificial intelligence in education and law. The object of research in this article is artificial intelligence technologies. The subject of the research is the ways of improving and developing artificial intelligence in its application in education and law. The degree of scientific development of the topic of the publication. In the studies of A. A. Verbitsky, N. S. Ilyushenko, N. B. Strekalova, N. S. Kramarenko, A. Yu. Kvashina, S. D. Karakozova, A. Yu.Uvarova and A. Y.Akimova, on which this article is based, talk about the properties of digital education and the use of artificial intelligence technologies in it, about its possible advantages. Among them: accessibility, increasing the level of interactivity of training, the ability to choose the time, maximum audience coverage. The practical significance of the research lies in the possibility of applying its results in educational institutions of secondary education, secondary vocational education and higher education. Conclusions of the study: 1. Intellectual is a system that allows you to enhance a person’s mental activity by conducting a meaningful dialogue with him. 2. It is obvious that it is impossible and unnecessary to create a universal artificial intelligence. Highly specialized intellectual systems should be created, for example in education and law, which will not replace a person, but will facilitate his work. A person is not able to read a novel in one minute. The computer can do it. 3. The joint activity of man and machine, which analyzes information and presents it for selection, becomes relevant. 4. Today, artificial intelligence is a self-learning tool that enhances human activity in generating and making decisions. 5. In the current period, it will be necessary to resolve the issue of correlating the experience of introducing artificial intelligence into the most important social institutions of society, including education, and the existing proven practices of the traditional form of education.","","979-8-3503-2656-7","10.1109/TELE58910.2023.10184378","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10184378","artificial intelligence;digital education;law;technologies in law;informatization of education;educational process;education","Training;Learning systems;Resistance;Education;Standards organizations;Learning (artificial intelligence);Problem-solving","","1","","9","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The study of the topology known as complex network theory has revealed the omnipresence of power law topology in many real networks. This power law topology is known to provide high efficiency in data exchange among individual nodes as well as robustness against random failures on them. For this reason, this topological structure has been adopted in several algorithms for the construction of an overlay network in the context of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. All of them are based on a growing mechanism that requires continuous joining process of nodes. In this paper we propose a non-growing algorithm to construct a power law topology for overlay networks which have important implications for the evolution of the Internet to the next generation networks. The implementation of the algorithm is fully distributed that does not require a centrally dedicated server, thus, make them more secure against a single point failure of the system. Moreover, we demonstrate how the rewired topology takes advantage of its topological structure by analyzing its basic topological properties as well as robustness and efficiency.","2166-0077","978-1-4244-8865-0","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2010.5700333","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5700333","Self-Organizing;Future networks;Power law topology;non-growing mechanism","Topology;Peer to peer computing;Robustness;Organizing;Internet;Complex networks","","1","","14","IEEE","24 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To solve these problems, the sliding mode control method based on improved reaching law is proposed. In improved reaching law, reasonable reaching terms are designed and the continuous function is used instead of symbolic function. The stability of improved reaching law is proved by Lyapunov stability theory.

However, LOS guidance law has a contradiction between rapidity and overshoot, as well as a steady-state error caused by waves, wind and ocean currents. This paper proposes an adaptive LOS (ALOS) guidance law that can balance rapidity and overshoot while compensating for sideslip angle. The proposed algorithm uses adaptive parameter based on the cross-track error to real-time adjust the look-ahead distance and adaptively calculate a reasonable desired heading angle. An adaptive integral state is designed based on the adaptive parameter to compensate the impact of sideslip angle and then calculate the desired heading angle. Through stability analysis, it is proven that ALOS has uniform semiglobal exponential stability (USGES) at the balancing point. Finally, lake trials results shows that ALOS effectively suppressed overshoot and compensated for disturbance of waves, wind and ocean currents while reducing lateral cross-track error by 52.3% in similar converge speed with LOS.

Following this reasoning, we present a novel and fast source coding algorithm for wireless sensor measurements. In more details, the Benford's probability density distribution is exploited for Huffmann coding of measured values, considering the Benford probability density of the first digit. This results may be fast obtained assuming the Benford's law validity, without directly computing the a priori probabilities of the measured digits. Performance evaluation is provided by system simulations, comparing the obtained results with the computed a posteriori source entropy.","","978-1-4673-2738-1","10.1109/EESMS.2012.6348393","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6348393","","Wireless sensor networks;Source coding;Wireless communication;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements","","","","13","IEEE","10 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to put forward the layout scheme of wireless temperature sensor in the on-line temperature monitoring system of dry-type air-core reactor, the finite element temperature simulation calculation is carried out according to the principle of multi-physical field coupling, and the radial and axial temperature distribution laws of the reactor are summarized and analyzed. In the radial direction, the encapsulation temperature of the middle layer was higher than that of the outer layer. In the axial direction, the temperature gradually increases from the bottom to the top, and the highest hot spot of each layer is located at the upper part of the axial height of the reactor. The accuracy of the finite element simulation calculation was confirmed by the outermost encapsulation temperature of the infrared detection, and the layout scheme of the wireless temperature sensor was proposed. The simulation is carried out when different encapsulations fail. When the reactor fails, the hottest spot of temperature changes from the top of the reactor to the fault location. The closer to the fault location, the higher the temperature rises. And the fault occurs at any position in the axial direction, at least one sensor can detect the temperature change. Combined with the distribution of hot spots in normal operation and fault, the layout position of temperature sensor is verified to improve the effectiveness and reliability of temperature detection.","","979-8-3503-3058-8","10.1109/CRC60659.2023.10488534","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10488534","dry-type air-core reactor;finite element analysis;wireless temperature measurement;sensor layout","Temperature sensors;Encapsulation;Temperature measurement;Wireless communication;Temperature distribution;Wireless sensor networks;Layout","","","","22","IEEE","9 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, the MDOF robots are over constrained systems, which are difficult to control. By this reason, MDOF robots are limited to simple applications, like following a guide-wire. In order to obtain an autonomous behavior, we propose the use of a nonlinear control law, which exponentially leads the robot to a desired position with a given orientation. A new set of error variables is defined in order to propose the control vector. This control vector makes the final configuration globally exponentially stable.

The space weather community has invested a significant effort to 1) detect where and when such irregularities occur, 2) statistically quantify the scintillations produced, and 3) assess the disruption of technological systems and services that can result in significant societal impact. Traditional methods for detecting and characterizing irregularities have utilized specialized and expensive GNSS scintillation monitors specifically designed to measure rapid signal fluctuations. From a coverage perspective, the number and availability of these sensors is quite limited. For this reason, we explore alternative methods for global irregularity monitoring and characterization using existing sensors and infrastructure. In an earlier work, we demonstrated that inexpensive (COTS) receivers that measure total electron content can provide quantitative measurements of integrated turbulence strength and the scintillation index, S4 (Carrano et al, JGR, 2019; Carrano et al., Proc. ION 2019). This work was subsequently generalized to provide quantitative predictions of the phase scintillation index, sigma-phi (Carrano et al, COSP AR, 2022).

The sentence did not recognize the existence of such general duty but sentenced to jail the three managers for the infringement of Italian privacy law. According to Court opinion the three manager did not complain with the duty to acquire the consent of all the individuals before the treatment of their personal data. A duty extended by the Court's decision to the case of the uploading, in GoogleVideo, of a defamatory video even if the treatment of personal data of the victim was made not by Google but by the uploader of the video. The Court bringing out the contents of privacy regulation created, at least, for the all SP, a de facto duty to prevent criminal conducts committed by others. This statement will be discussed underling that the active collaboration of SP with criminal law enforcement agencies is necessary for real security reasons but may be considered a lawful tool in the social control of computer related crime only if pressing limits of proportionality principle are satisfies.","2156-7190","978-1-4244-8150-7","10.1109/INTERNET.2010.48","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5616311","Computer related crimes;Prevention;Criminal Law;Internet Service Providers;Fundamental Rights","","","","","20","IEEE","1 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study investigates such a mechanism by adopting a logistic model of game outcome uncertainty where a measure of game refinement had been derived. Application of such a measure to the popular board and sports games have been conducted to determine its implication in determining sophisticated design and has defined the harmonic balance between skill and chance. A theoretical analysis using practical data confirms the effectiveness of the proposed model, where reasonable game length is determined based on the definition of a gamified experience. The model is further expanded with the analogy of physics in mind. The law of motions in the game is formalized by considering the derivatives of the game progress model, where the link between game refinement theory and flow theory is identified and discussed.

Ideal diffuse reflection, aka Lambertian reflection, has equal reflected energy at all angles away from the plane. This leads to Lambert's cosine law that says the observed radiance from the area will be proportional to the cosine of the incidence angle. This result has been interpreted in differing ways which we will address here to show that the same reasoning leads to other 'laws' in other situations. The key is that Lambert's law refers to a defined illuminated area of a plane and the energy coming off that area, for an ideal diffuse reflector when irradiated at a particular angle of incidence. It is the result of the geometry that the range of incident angles of light reaching the observer will follow exactly the cosine law. In the case sidescan sonar the area being ensonified also changes with the angle as does the area contributing to the reflected energy in a particular time bin. This changes the cosine law to a cotangent law. The sine in the denominator is due to the changing size of the area being observed at different angles.","2377-6536","978-1-7281-8757-0","10.1109/AUV50043.2020.9267946","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9267946","","Sonar;Sea surface;Backscatter;Sonar measurements;Solids;Transducers;Geometry","","7","","15","IEEE","30 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this problem, this study proposes a novel sliding mode fault-tolerant control method for PMSM demagnetization faults. First, the mathematical model of PMSM under demagnetization fault state is established, and the reasons for poor fault tolerance of the conventional PI controller are analyzed. A new convergence law is used to design the speed loop sliding mode feedback controller, and its stability is demonstrated. Meanwhile, an adaptive forgetting factor recursive least squares (AFRLS) flux linkage observer is designed to keep the controller parameter values in line with the actual motor parameter values, to reduce the impact of demagnetization faults on motor control performance and achieve fault-tolerant control of demagnetization faults. Finally, simulation and experimental comparison with conventional PI control demonstrate that the proposed method is more robust and resistant to interference.","2836-4619","","10.23919/CJEE.2024.000082","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52077011); Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:2024JJ7614,2024JJ7615,2024JJ6089); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10596094","Permanent magnet synchronous motor;demagnetization faults;sliding mode fault-tolerant control;flux linkage observer","Demagnetization;Mathematical models;Fault tolerant systems;Fault tolerance;Couplings;Torque;Permanent magnets","","1","","26","","11 Jul 2024","","","CMP","CMP Journals"

As an introduction, a review of the PO theory for Gaussian-correlated surfaces is provided, and in this process an analytical summation of the PO series for specular scattering from Gaussian-correlated surfaces is obtained. A similar form is then derived for specular scattering from exponentially correlated surfaces and contrasted to the Gaussian case. These series allow the accuracy of the leading order term (i.e., the geometrical optics limit) in the high-frequency approximation of PO scattering for Gaussian or exponentially correlated surfaces to be investigated analytically. The leading order term in the high-frequency expansion for general PO scattering from exponentially correlated surfaces (Hagfors' Law) is then reviewed and interpreted in terms of a recently published theory of PO for surfaces with infinite rms slopes. The approximate ldquocutoffrdquo wavenumber from Hagfors' Law at which the high-frequency portion of the spectrum of an exponentially correlated surface can be truncated without producing large errors in PO predicted scattering is also discussed. Using this cutoff wavenumber, an approximate region of validity of the complete PO theory for exponentially correlated surfaces is obtained. The validity condition indicates that, for fixed surface statistics, the PO method produces accurate predictions of true surface scattering only up to a specific frequency, and that PO is inaccurate in the high-frequency limit. Comparisons of PO predictions with those of a Monte Carlo numerical simulation are used to show that the validity condition derived appears to provide a reasonable indication of PO accuracy. These results have important implications for current investigations of scattering from exponentially correlated surfaces and for the use of Hagfors' Law, as it is traditional to accept PO as the appropriate high-frequency limit in most existing approximate models of surface scattering.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2007.900682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4276889","Rough surface scattering","Geometrical optics;Physical optics;Optical scattering;Optical surface waves;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Gaussian processes;Surface waves;Statistics;Frequency","","31","","17","IEEE","23 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Besides, the related verification experiments are carried out, and the melting erosion law of the contact interface is obtained. The results of simulations and experiments show the following conclusions: First, during the launching, the contact force between armature and rails varies with current fluctuation. Second, the friction heat power varies directly with the contact force, but Joule thermal power caused by contact resistance varies inversely with the contact force. Third, the ambient temperature of the sliding contact interface can be further improved by reasonable design of armature shrink range. Fourth, due to the inevitable wear during sliding, the melting area of the armature contact surface gradually transfers from the initial contact area to the tail.

The global, decentralized nature of cloud computing presents numerous issues that we are just now grappling with in our endeavors to protect privacy rights, meet compliance demands, and maintain a secure computing environment. This chapter covers effective risk management, risk metrics, and strategies for an effective risk management program. Policies are one of the foundational elements of a governance and risk management program. They guide the organization, based on standards and guidelines. Policies ensure that the organization is operating within its risk profile. Policies actually define, or are the expression of, the organization's risk tolerance. Cloud computing as it exists today has commoditized compute, storage and networking services. Enterprise risk management has shifted in response to this change. It is vitally important that both the customer and the provider focus on risk management and the challenges presented with cloud computing. The cloud customer (in the role of data owner) is ultimately responsible for ensuring control effectiveness, but stored data, security, and risk management require a partnership between the customer and provider.","","9781119603382","10.1002/9781119603351.ch11","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9821705.pdf&bkn=9820843&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Organizations;Law;Standards organizations;Stakeholders;Risk management;Regulators","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

Many of the electrical regulations, which are set out at 30 C.F.R. Part 56.12, can be fairly characterized as simplistic, broad, dated and confusing. MSHA often reads requirements or prohibitions into its regulations that are not evident from the language of the regulations. Mine operators need to understand that the regulations are essentially interpreted by MSHA using a “reasonably prudent person” standard. An operator's failure to anticipate MSHA's changing expectations for a reasonably prudent person can result in substantial penalties, closure orders, abatement predicaments and even penalties against its management. Supervisors and managers with responsibility for electrical systems, particularly those using newer technologies that are beyond MSHA's expertise, need to be proactive in anticipating, avoiding and addressing creative MSHA enforcement.","2155-9155","978-1-4799-3294-8","10.1109/CITCon.2014.6820116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820116","","Standards;Inspection;Gravity;Auditory system;Government;Hazards","","","","9","IEEE","26 May 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The idea is a modification of the well-studied preferential attachment scheme in which the degree of each node is used to determine its evolving connectivity. Modifications to this base protocol to include features other than connectivity have been considered in building the network. However, schemes based on preferential attachment in any form require substantial information on the entire network. We propose instead a protocol based only on a single statistical feature which results from the reasonable assumption that the effect of various attributes, which determine the ability of each node to attract other nodes, is multiplicative. This composite attribute or fitness is lognormally distributed and is used in forming the complex network. We show that, by varying the parameters of the lognormal distribution, we can recover both exponential and power-law degree distributions. The exponents for the power-law case are in the correct range seen in real- world networks such as the World Wide Web and the Internet. Further, as power-law networks with exponents in the same range are a crucial ingredient of efficient search algorithms in peer-to- peer networks, we believe our network construct may serve as a basis for new protocols that will enable peer-to-peer networks to efficiently establish a topology conducive to optimized search procedures.","1095-2055","978-1-4244-4581-3","10.1109/ICCCN.2009.5235257","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5235257","","Protocols;Power generation;Peer to peer computing;Complex networks;IP networks;Computer science;Mathematics;Physics;Web sites;Network topology","","2","","25","IEEE","11 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The guidance law ensures the missile’s seeker remains within the specified FOV even with large initial lead angles, improving stability and enhancing launch flexibility in complex environments. By selecting reasonable control parameters, the impact time error and lead angle of the missile converge rapidly, boosting guidance efficiency. Lyapunov stability theory verifies its reliability and safety, and the absence of singularities in the guidance command significantly enhances the system’s stability and robustness. The simulation results show that the proposed guidance law is adaptable to varieties of working conditions and exhibits excellent performance.

With the recent surge in the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for predictive analytics, data-driven PHM is now more prominent. Notwithstanding the popularity of AI approaches, actual adoption and implementation in fielded systems has been minimal. One of the reasons for this is the lag in an ancillary area, which is the development of corresponding standards and regulations to guide the practice. This paper aims to synthesize various studies in the literature regarding standards and regulations in data-driven PHM and then sets out the necessary requirements for a standards and regulations regime to support the full adoption of AI-enabled PHM. An acceptability criterion is proposed, which incorporates the various factors that must be considered for verification, validation, and certification of AI-enabled PHM technologies. The use of the acceptability criterion is demonstrated, which will potentially be very useful to certification bodies and regulatory agencies in the process of approving AI-enabled PHM for use in safety-critical assets.","","978-1-86043-557-7","10.23919/ICAC50006.2021.9594069","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9594069","artificial intelligence (AI);prognostics and health management (PHM);standards and regulations;data-driven prognostics;remaining useful life (RUL)","Regulators;Standards organizations;Organizations;Prediction algorithms;Regulation;Prognostics and health management;Artificial intelligence","","1","","30","","15 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Identity and Access Management (IAM) service is designed to allow you to specify what operations specific users can perform on particular resources. This is also described as specifying “who gets to do what on which resources.” IAM is the recommended way to control access in most cases. In some limited cases, such as in a development environment, the older primitive roles system may be used. An identity is an entity that represents a person or other agent that performs actions on a GCP resource. Identities are sometimes called members. Google accounts are used by people and represent people who interact with GCP, such as developers and administrators. These accounts are designated by an email address that is linked to a Google account. For example, jane.doe@gmail.com could be an identity in GCP. The domain of the email does not have to be gmail.com; it just has to be associated with a Google account. Service accounts are used by applications running in GCP. These are used to give applications their own set of access controls instead of relying on using a person's account for permissions. Service accounts are also designated by email addresses.","","9781119602507","10.1002/9781119602477.ch7","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9823165.pdf&bkn=9820842&pdfType=chapter","","Cloud computing;Engines;Organizations;Law;Access control;Task analysis;Virtual machining","","","","","","12 Jul 2022","","","Wiley","Wiley Data and Cybersecurity eBook Chapters"

With the growing consciousness of the consumers, it has become imperative for the business houses to act sustainably. Therefore, to put that responsibility into practice, the concept of issuance of green finance emerged, certain sources of green finance are green bonds, and green corporate social responsibility is dedicated to financing green projects that intend to upgrade the environment. However, with green finance, the challenging problem of greenwashing pops up, which deceives customers and other stakeholders into believing that the operations of corporate houses are environmentally sustainable. The researchers have emphasized the role of legal provisions that are attempting to leave no stone unturned to engage corporate houses in environment preservation nevertheless, there are certain lacunae associated with those legislations. Such norms are thriving to pay attention to the environmental degradation caused due to business houses and further compelling them to address these challenges in various forms ranging from issuance of green debt securities, calling out greenwashing to mandatory corporate social responsibility. The impact of green debt securities in advancing sustainability is descriptively discussed thereby addressing the various challenges associated with it that call for legal acknowledgment such as the lack of internal capacity and regime to manage the green bond process, the complex rules that require compliance, and the deceiving practices of companies such as greenwashing. Certain regulations dealing with green financing and responsible investment are critically examined concerning environmentally advanced countries in this study.</p>","","9781394234011","10.1002/9781394234035.ch6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10955548.pdf&bkn=10955395&pdfType=chapter","","Green products;Air pollution;Finance;Security;Law;Investment;Climate change;Business;Companies;Sustainable development","","","","","","8 Apr 2025","","","Wiley","Wiley AI eBook Chapters"

Intelligent transport systems navigation services are now directly targeting travelers due to smartphones and their embedded sensors. However, after a decade of research, no universal personal navigation system has been successfully introduced and adopted to improve personal mobility. An analysis of the underlying reasons is conducted, looking at the engineering, human, ethical, and legal challenges. First, contrary to adopting classical mechanization equations linked to solid state physics, location technologies must address complex personal dynamics using connected objects. Second, human factors are often not sufficiently considered while designing new technologies. The needs and abilities of travelers are not systematically addressed from a user-centered perspective. Finally, people want to benefit from location-based services without sharing personal location data to uncontrolled third bodies. Europe is a pioneer in the protection of individuals from personal identification through data processing since location data has been recognized as personal data, but the challenges to enforce the regulation are numerous. The recommendation of “privacy by design and default” is an interesting key to conceive the universal personal navigation solution. Alternative solutions are highlighted, but they definitively require a more interdisciplinary conception.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2016.2563481","European Marie Curie Skłodowska Actions fellowships for the smartWALK project; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7480831","Pedestrian navigation;positioning technologies;Design challenges;personal data privacy;navigation","Navigation;Vehicle dynamics;Vehicles;Algorithm design and analysis;Mobile communication;Heuristic algorithms;Legged locomotion","","15","","88","OAPA","30 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

There is a considerable `legal lacuna' that exists creating much uncertainty within the industry with respect to investment and the direction of innovation. Drones are being utilised today under controlled conditions as technology and ability develops, but with this accelerated pace of technological development, existing regulations soon become limited to address new capabilities and thus become out of date. Policy has become law in many jurisdictions, but policy needs to be developed further to keep pace with demand because safety is paramount. This paper investigates and highlights legal aspects that a regulator and UTM stakeholders have to consider in developing good drone law. It is essential that a properly considered legal framework is developed for many reasons including, but not limited to, increased positive public perception, proliferation of innovation of use cases for Unmanned Aerial Systems, improved environmental impact and improved safety.

In addition to these reasons, India also has one of the world's lowest ratios of judges to population. For swift and efficient disposal of justice, it is important to fast-track this process as much as possible.

The observations were performed in six spectral bands that span the spectral range from the near-ultraviolet atmospheric cut-off to the near-infrared. We derive the extinction law by the extragalactic dust in the dark lanes in the spectral range 1.11 < λ−1 < 2.94 μm−1 by fitting model galaxies to the unextinguished parts of the image, and subtracting from these the actual images. This procedure allows the derivation, with reasonably high signal-to-noise ratio, of the extinction in each spectral band we used for each resolution element of the image. We also introduce an alternative method to derive the extinction values by comparing various colour-index maps under the assumption of negligible intrinsic colour gradients in these galaxies. We than compare the results obtained using these two methods. We compare the total-to-selective extinction derived for these galaxies with previously obtained results and with similar extinction values of Milky Way dust to derive conclusions about the properties of extragalactic dust in different objects and conditions. We find that the extinction curves run parallel to the Galactic extinction curve, which implies that the properties of dust in the extragalactic environment are similar to those of the Milky Way, despite our original expectations. The ratio of the total V-band extinction to the selective extinction between the V and B bands is derived for each galaxy with an average of 2.82 ± 0.38, compared to a canonical value of 3.1 for the Milky Way. The similar values imply that galaxies with well-defined dark lanes have characteristic dust grain sizes similar to those of Galactic dust. We use total optical extinction values to estimate the dust mass for each galaxy, compare these with dust masses derived from IRAS measurements, and find them in the range 104–107M⊙.","1365-2966","","10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13785.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8220117","dust, extinction;galaxies: elliptical and lenticular, cD","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Thus, we propose a network-wide traffic volume estimation method using data from connected vehicles with the observed traffic volume data. This method employs joint matrix factorization, which facilitates the integrated analysis of diverse data sources. Furthermore, we incorporated traffic flow conservation law to ensure the conservation of inflow and outflow at each intersection as a regularization term. We verified the proposed method using actual urban traffic data and confirmed that the proposed method achieved a higher accuracy than those of related baseline methods.

The proposed control laws are based on the distance-based formation control; therefore, each distance between agents is controlled measuring the relative position. Because the control laws use only local information such as relative position with respect to their own local reference frame, the control laws are completely decentralized. The proposed control laws are designed to make a group of agents keep the desired formation and move with a constant reference velocity in two-dimensional space. The considered system consists of three types of agents: 1) leader; 2) first follower; and 3) follower. The leader knows the reference velocity value, whereas the other agents do not know the reference velocity. For this reason, the first follower and follower estimate the reference velocity by using the adaptive method. Using graph theory and nonlinear control theory, the control laws are verified mathematically. Additionally, the three-agent case is extended to $N$-agent case by an inductive way. The stability and convergence of the system are theoretically analyzed, and the validity of the proposed control laws is clarified by performing simulations and real experiments.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2015.2504041","Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism (MCST); Korea Creative Content Agency (KOCCA); Culture Technology (CT) Research & Development Program 2014; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7337446","Formation control;Adaptive method;Distributed control;Adaptive method;distributed control;formation control;nonlinear control","Position measurement;Multi-agent systems;Convergence;Aerospace electronics;Animals;Shape;Stability analysis","","77","","28","IEEE","25 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These variations in ENF cause the luminance intensity of a mains-powered light source, having no AC/DC converter inside, also to fluctuate. As a result, a video of a scene illuminated by a mains-powered light source can be used to estimate these fluctuations. As a consequence, the ENF signal within the time period when the video was captured can be estimated. This work explores the effects of frame rate harmonics that emerge when a rolling shutter based approach is used for ENF estimation from videos captured using CMOS cameras. These harmonics are a problem, especially for videos whose frame rate is a divisor of the nominal ENF because the frame rate harmonics and the ENF harmonics overlap. It is discovered that a key reason for the presence of the harmonics is the inverse square law of light that results in some repeating patterns of luminance variation across frames. This paper presents an analysis of the effect of the inverse square law of light on ENF estimation. A technique for refined ENF-related luminance signal estimation is proposed that attenuates these frame rate harmonics. This enables more accurate ENF estimates. The work also proposes an approach to estimate ENF-related luminance waveform cycles within each video frame, and a method to compute the confidence score for the estimated cycles. It provides insight into the reliability of the extracted ENF signal from a video, in the sense of its usefulness for ENF forensics, and consequently for ENF detection, which is an important precursor to ENF-based video forensics.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2022.3220029","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency; Air Force Research Laboratory(grant numbers:FA8750-16-2-0173); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9940312","ENF;electric network frequency;video forensics;multimedia forensics;camera forensics;rolling shutter;idle period;frame rate harmonics;time-of-recording;time-stamp verification","Videos;Harmonic analysis;Estimation;Light sources;Cameras;Forensics;Frequency estimation","","8","","41","IEEE","4 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Cyberbullying and cyber law","B. E. Cartwright","School of Criminology Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, B.C., Canada","2016 IEEE International Conference on Cybercrime and Computer Forensic (ICCCF)","17 Nov 2016","2016","","","1","7","This paper examines two recent Canadian legislative initiatives intended in whole or in part to combat cyberbullying: the Cyber-Safety Act of Nova Scotia and the Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act. Both pieces of legislation were responses to the suicide deaths of female teenagers Rehtaeh Parsons in Nova Scotia and Amanda Todd in British Columbia. It is questionable whether either suicide was directly caused by cyberbullying. Todd was primarily a victim of an adult “capper” living in the Netherlands, who persuaded her to expose her breasts via web cam, and then attempted to use the captured images to extort money and more images. Parsons was filmed engaging in what police concluded was consensual sex with several teenage boys at a house party. The cell phone video was posted on the Internet, making Parsons a victim of “sexting.” In 2014, the Supreme Court of Canada fired a shot across the bow of Bill C-30, the immediate predecessor to the Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act, ruling that a police search (permissible under Bill C-30) in a child pornography case infringed upon constitutional protection against unreasonable search and seizure, and upon the right to privacy in cyberspace. In 2015, the Cyber-Safety Act of Nova Scotia was struck down by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia because it violated constitutional rights to freedom of expression and to life, liberty and security of person. In a criminal harassment case involving Twitter, the Ontario Court of Justice ruled in 2016 that Twitter is like a public square, where freedom of expression is protected, and where there is no reasonable expectation of privacy. These three court decisions can be expected to limit the extent to which Canadian legislators and law enforcement agencies can go in their efforts to pursue and prosecute cyberbullies and/or cyber criminals.","","978-1-5090-6096-2","10.1109/ICCCF.2016.7740430","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7740430","cyberbullying;Canadian cyber law;sexting;capping;freedom of expression;right to privacy","Law enforcement;Internet;Privacy;Cyberspace;Legislation","","4","","36","IEEE","17 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are two reasons for this gap: first, States are traditionally reluctant to publicly discuss or internationally regulate sharing of information with partners. Second, the law of neutrality has become a niche discipline in the past years when major international armed conflicts (IAC) were often considered to be passé. However, in today’s digitalized societies, information has acquired a value similar to physical goods. Supporting a belligerent with data may therefore be just as problematic from a neutrality perspective as delivering weapons. This paper discusses the important implications of the law of neutrality for neutral States to share data obtained in cyberspace. After introducing a neutrality framework that takes contemporary State practice into account, I illustrate that the discussions on neutrality in the context of the Russia-Ukraine war are neither new nor unaddressed. A short case study will outline the inherent tensions between a neutral State’s impartiality and its preventive obligations. Weighing these two factors in the context of an interconnected, cyber-driven security landscape, I argue that during an IAC, a neutral has the ability, but not the obligation, to share certain information with selected partners. However, this does not include militarily actionable data, as such sharing would violate the neutral State’s fundamental impartiality obligations.","2325-5374","978-9916-9789-3-1","10.23919/CyCon58705.2023.10181885","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181885","law of neutrality;cyber-enabled data;data sharing;impartiality;prevention","Weapons;Government;Information sharing;Cyberspace;Security","","1","","0","","19 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, high system throughput does not necessarily translate to good delay performance. Recent studies show that exponential backoff, the key collision avoidance mechanism in distributed coordination function (DCF) of 802.11, is fundamentally defected in the sense that it induces divergent moments of medium access delay. Essentially, the medium access delay follows a power law distribution, a subclass of heavy tailed distribution. With practical system configurations, the delay variance can easily approach infinity, which translates to service starvation of some users and eventually leads to severe unfairness among users. In this paper, we show that the power law delay distribution can be mitigated if exponential backoff is replaced by a polynomial backoff mechanism. Through rigorous analysis, we find that all delay moments are finite with polynomial backoff, thus fundamentally solving the problem of starvation and unfairness. In addition, polynomial backoff yields a similarly high throughput as exponential backoff with a practical network size when the order of the polynomial backoff function is set reasonably. In this sense, we argue that polynomial backoff is a better alternative than exponential backoff in IEEE 802.11 DCF, especially when there are increasingly more broadband multimedia traffics with stringent delay requirements in the network.","1938-1883","978-1-4577-2053-6","10.1109/ICC.2012.6363967","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6363967","","Delay;Throughput;Polynomials;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Convergence;Wireless LAN","","","","14","IEEE","29 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The law and policy program (D-DCRCLPP) of the data-to-decisions cooperative research center provides examples of the various ways that regulation affects the economy and, in turn, living standards. As a result, only a limited amount of capital, labor, and technology may be used in the production process. Regulation, when done incorrectly, has the potential to stifle innovation and learning while also limiting opportunities for everyone. Big Data technology (BDT) has been studied, with a focus on privacy and data protection techniques, which led to the formulation of this policy proposal based on privacy law (PL). Several perspectives are provided, each with benefits and weaknesses. These perspectives come from the domains of governance, law, economics, and information science. Enormous, linked, and information sharing are multifaceted ways that necessitate the use of a variety of technologies to promote and protect people's economic and political rights. Existing and emerging rules of international economic law have an indirect impact on such projects. New regulations for digital commerce are meant to ensure global data mobility. At the same time, international investment law will most likely be used to defend governments attempting to compel data sharing from private data holders. For these reasons, international economic law limits governments' ability to cope with asymmetric data ownership while promoting information holders' right to preserve control over data placement and utilization. Finally, recommendations are offered to foster a broader conversation, resulting in an overall performance of 96.7%.","","979-8-3315-3496-7","10.1109/ICERCS63125.2024.10895428","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10895428","Big Data;Technology;Economic Law;and privacy;Regulation of Economic","Economics;Industries;Data privacy;Technological innovation;Privacy;Big Data;Regulation;Internet of Things;Protection;Standards","","","","15","IEEE","27 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Others respond that while the social norms that create the basis of collective self-regulation do provide real constraint in cyberspace, software code, not social norms, will provide the most efficient means of regulating on-line behavior. CMC research suggests that virtual communities are capable of limited forms of self-regulation through emerging systems of social dynamics. This paper explicates this debate by weighting the merits of community self-regulation and technological regulation through an examination of the development and use of interactive behavioral mechanisms to regulate interaction at an adult-oriented web site.","","0-7695-1209-7","10.1109/ISTAS.2001.937730","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=937730","","Ethics;Computer aided software engineering;Computer mediated communication;Law;Internet;Protection;Legal factors;Speech;Government;Writing","","","","41","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Firstly, a reasonable sample node is used to quickly obtain the critical propagation domain threshold as a screening criterion. And filtering the key nodes with this threshold can significantly reduce the total traversal workload. In order to further reduce workload, this paper proposes a filtering method of critical nodes that threshold is based on the number of packets that the nodes can affect. After a number of experiments, the result shows that the proposed method can effectively reduce the traversal workload of locating key nodes.","","978-1-5386-4210-8","10.1109/DSC.2018.00144","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8411965","key nodes;node's propagation domain;the number of packages that the node can affect","Software systems;Complexity theory;Indexes;Correlation;Security;Complex networks","","","","18","IEEE","19 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Seismic Q estimates in Umbria Marche (Central Italy): hints for the retrieval of a new attenuation law for seismic risk","A. Pisconti; E. Del Pezzo; F. Bianco; S. de Lorenzo","NA; NA; NA; NA","Geophysical Journal International","18 Jan 2018","2015","201","3","1370","1382","In the Umbria–Marche (Central Italy) region an important earthquake sequence occurred in 1997, characterized by nine earthquakes with magnitudes in the range between 5 and 6, that caused important damages and causalities. In the present paper, we separately estimate intrinsic and scattering Q−1 parameters, using the classical multiple lapse time window analysis (MLTWA) approach in the assumption of a half-space model. The results clearly show that the attenuation parameters Qi−1 and Qs−1 are frequency dependent. This estimate is compared with other attenuation studies carried out in the same area, and with all the other MLTWA estimates obtained till now in other tectonic environments in the Earth. The bias introduced by the half-space assumption is investigated through numerical solutions of the energy transport equation in the more realistic assumption of a heterogeneous crust overlying a transparent mantle, with a Moho located at a depth ranging between 35 and 45 km below the surface. The bias introduced by the half-space assumption is significant only at high frequency. We finally show how the attenuation estimates, calculated with different techniques, lead to different peak ground acceleration decay with distance relationships, using the well-known and well proven Boore's method. This last result indicates that care must be used in selecting the correct estimate of the attenuation parameters for seismic risk purposes. We also discuss the reason why MLTWA may be chosen among all the other available techniques, due to its intrinsic stability, to obtain the right attenuation parameters.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggv055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8188076","Coda waves;Seismic attenuation;Computational seismology;Wave scattering and diffraction","","","1","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"
"The Turn of Moore’s Law from Space to Time—The Crisis, The Perspective and The Strategy [Book Review]","D. Nenni","NA","IEEE Circuits and Systems Magazine","16 Jan 2023","2022","22","4","76","80","It’s time for the big ship of Moore’s Law to make a turn” is a nonconformist message that has surprised me when I first encountered this book of “The Turn of Moore’s Law from Space to Time” by Mr. Liming Xiu. There is a great number of books on Moore’s Law in the market, some of which focuses on the history side of this “Law”, some on the business aspect of this “Law”, and many more on the topics related to the technical developments of microelectronics. As a forty-year veteran in this industry and as an author of several books on semiconductor industry myself, I have seen a lot and I am quite familiar with all contemporary discussions on Moore’s Law. This book strikes me with its adventurous insight and broad view. If More Moore is regarded as Moore’s Law 1.0, More Than Moore as Moore’s Law 1.1 and Beyond Moore as Moore’s Law 1.2, then the Time Moore (to use time more, as the author explains in the book) can be considered as Moore’s Law 2.0. This is due to the reason that, in this work, Moore’s Law is investigated from the depth of two fundamental constituents of our universal: space and time; for the first time, microelectronics is inspected at its root for a potential detour to circumvent the space crisis that this field is currently facing. Physics, the progenitor of all branches of science and engineering, is the place where new insights shall be sought, as history has taught us many times. Moore’s Law 1.x is about space, Moore’s Law 2.0 focuses on time (space has however not been forgotten, as clarified by the author throughout the book).","1558-0830","","10.1109/MCAS.2022.3214589","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10018019","","Book reviews;Moore's Law;Microelectronics;History;Electronics industry;Transistors","","","","0","IEEE","16 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
