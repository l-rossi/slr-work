"Changing legal systems: legal abrogations and annulments in Defeasible Logic","G. Governatori; A. Rotolo",NA; NA,Logic Journal of the IGPL,"18 Jan 2018","2010","18","1","157","194","In this paper we investigate how to represent and reason about legal abrogations and annulments in Defeasible Logic. We examine some options that embed in this setting, and in similar rule-based systems, ideas from belief and base revision. In both cases, our conclusion is negative, which suggests to adopt a different logical model. This model expresses temporal aspects of legal rules, and distinguishes between two main timelines, one internal to a given temporal version of the legal system, and another relative to how the legal system evolves over time. Accordingly, we propose a temporal extension of Defeasible Logic suitable to express this model and to capture abrogation and annulment. We show that the proposed framework overcomes the difficulties discussed in regard to belief and base revision, and is sufficiently flexible to represent many of the subtleties characterizing legal abrogations and annulments.","1368-9894","","10.1093/jigpal/jzp075","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8146473","Norm dynamics;Temporal Defeasible Logic;Abrogation and annulment;Belief and base revision","","","1","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Industry governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) solutions are document-oriented and expert-driven. Formal compliance checking techniques in contrast attempt to provide ways for rigorous modeling and analysis of regulatory compliance but miss out on holistic GRC perspective due to missing integration between diverse set of (semi-) formal models. We show that streamlining regulatory compliance using multiple purposive models of various aspects of regulations, it is possible to leverage both the rigor of formal techniques and the holistic enterprise GRC perspective. Our contributions are twofold. First, we present a model-driven architecture based on a conceptual model of integrated GRC that is capable of addressing key challenges of regulatory compliance. Second, using Know Your Customer regulations in Indian context as a case study, we demonstrate the utility of this architecture. Initial results with KYC regulations are promising and point to further work in model-driven regulatory compliance.","","978-1-4673-6908-4","10.1109/MODELS.2015.7338275","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7338275","","Business;Vocabulary;Industries;Semantics;Law;Adaptation models","","9","","38","IEEE","30 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"A semantic model for causation in criminal law and the need of logico-legal criteria for the attribution of causation","P. de Sousa Mendes; J. Carmo",NA; NA,"Law, Probability and Risk","18 Jan 2018","2013","12","3-4","207","228","Causation as an element of a criminal offence is different from the probative difficulties. The empirical laws that are relevant to the proof of causation, as a pure matter of fact, are not discussed here, but only causality as a category of our understanding and a general law of the intelligible world. This general law of causality is equally valid for all result crimes (e.g. homicide, bodily harm, deception offences and criminal damage). According to the European continental theory of conditions, any ‘conditio sine qua non’ is by itself a cause. Causation is established by the formula of ‘conditio’ (similar to the so-called ‘but for’ test in the common law), which corresponds to a counterfactual reasoning. However, that formula is not able to resolve adequately those cases of causal overdetermination where the result occurred by means of actions of multiple, independently intervening agents. A semantic model of the world evolution, based upon ramified temporal logic, may assist the comprehension of causal connections between human actions and the relevant results. At the end of the day, this model allows us to understand that even in situations where no kind of factual uncertainty is present, doubts upon the attribution of causation to specific agents remain. We shall conclude that the attribution of causation is not a natural problem, but a logico-legal one, that has to be dealt with by way of logico-legal criteria. Nevertheless, attribution of causation must be clearly distinguished from objective imputation of proscribed harm.","1470-840X","","10.1093/lpr/mgt005","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8157858","causation;formula of conditio;counterfactuals;attribution of causation;objective imputation","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The primary goal of legal policy simulation is predicting how changes in the law affect measures of interest, e.g., revenue. Currently, legal policies are simulated via a combination of spreadsheets and software code. This poses a validation challenge both due to complexity reasons and due to legal experts lacking the expertise to understand software code. A further challenge is that representative data for simulation may be unavailable, thus necessitating a data generator. We develop a framework for legal policy simulation that is aimed at addressing these challenges. The framework uses models for specifying both legal policies and the probabilistic characteristics of the underlying population. We devise an automated algorithm for simulation data generation.

The obstacles to formalizing legal reasoning have proved to be the same ones that make the formalization of commonsense reasoning so difficult, and are most evident where legal reasoning has to meld with the vast web of ordinary human knowledge of the world.

Most existing studies treat the prediction of the three parts as separate tasks, and few consider the logical relationships between the subtasks. Additionally, some studies only establish multi-task learning models from the perspective of shared features, which fails to fully leverage the consistency constraints among subtasks. Therefore, this paper proposes a method based on multi-task learning, considering the logical relationships between subtasks, aiming to deeply explore the relevance between subtasks and guide the model to perform interpretable reasoning.

However, researchers struggle to classify confusing criminal cases, such as robbery and theft, which requires LJP models to distinguish the nuances between similar crimes. Existing methods usually design handcrafted features to pick up necessary semantic legal clues to make more accurate legal judgment predictions. In this paper, we propose a Semantic-Aware Dual Encoder Model (SEMDR), which designs a novel legal clue tracing mechanism to conduct fine-grained semantic reasoning between criminal facts and instruments. Our legal clue tracing mechanism is built from three reasoning levels: 1) Lexicon-Tracing, which aims to extract criminal facts from criminal descriptions; 2) Sentence Representation Learning, which contrastively trains language models to better represent confusing criminal facts; 3) Multi-Fact Reasoning, which builds a reasons graph to propagate semantic clues among fact nodes to capture the subtle difference among criminal facts. Our legal clue tracing mechanism helps SEMDR achieve state-of-the-art on the CAIL2018 dataset and shows its advance in few-shot scenarios. Our experiments show that SEMDR has a strong ability to learn more uniform and distinguished representations for criminal facts, which helps to make more accurate predictions on confusing criminal cases and reduces the model uncertainty during making judgments.

In this article, these approaches are discussed in light of a distinction between direct and indirect probabilistic reasoning. Direct probabilistic reasoning directly reasons from evidence to hypotheses, whereas indirect probabilistic reasoning reasons from hypotheses to evidence (and then back to the hypotheses). While statistical and story-based approaches usually model indirect probabilistic reasoning, argumentation-based approaches usually model direct probabilistic reasoning. It has been suggested that all legal probabilistic reasoning should be indirect, but in this article, it is argued that direct probabilistic reasoning has a rational basis and is, moreover, sometimes easier to perform for judges than indirect probabilistic reasoning. Moreover, direct probabilistic reasoning can be analysed in terms of standard probability theory, resulting in an alternative, non-Bayesian use of the terms ‘prior’ and ‘posterior’ probability and without the need to estimate unconditional probabilities of the hypotheses.","1470-840X","","10.1093/lpr/mgu013","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8157950","legal proof;statistics;narrative;argumentation;probabilistic reasoning","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Objective: This paper looks at how Indian legal laws could be analysed and understood using artificial neural networks (ANN). Great numbers of statutes, precedents, and interpretations define India’s complex legal environment. Conventional manual legal document analysis is sometimes timeconsuming and prone to human error; so, automated methods that can provide more accurate and efficient analysis are much needed. Methodology: We developed a model utilising ANN to manage this challenge by analysing and classifying legal documents depending on their content, context, and application to particular regulatory systems. The method consists in tagged with domain-specific tags training a neural network on a large collection of legal documents comprising statutes, case laws, and legal commentary. Using modern optimisation techniques including dropout regularisation and backpropagation, the ANN model was modified to increase its generalising capacity. According to the results, accuracy and efficiency have greatly raised themselves as compared to more traditional methods. Results and Findings: In determining legal language, the ANN model achieved an accuracy of $\mathbf{9 2. 3 \%}$, a precision of $\mathbf{9 0. 1 \%}$, a recall of 91.7%, and an $F 1$ score of 90.9%. The model also cut the time required for legal document interpretation, by roughly 45% as compared to traditional methods. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate how fast and consistently artificial intelligence can grasp legal texts, hence transforming legal analysis and regulatory compliance in India.","","979-8-3315-4121-7","10.1109/ICAICCIT64383.2024.10912260","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10912260","Artificial Neural Networks;Legal Analysis;Indian Regulations;AI in Law;Text Classification;Machine Learning","Training;Analytical models;Accuracy;Recurrent neural networks;Law;Text categorization;Artificial neural networks;Regulation;Artificial intelligence;Pragmatics","","","","15","IEEE","13 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Monitoring systems for requirements and policy compliance has been recognized in the requirements engineering community as a key area for research. Similarly, regulatory compliance is critical in systems that are governed by regulations and law, especially given that non-compliance can result in both financial and criminal penalties. Working with legal texts can be very challenging, however, because they contain numerous ambiguities, cross-references, domain-specific definitions, and acronyms, and are frequently amended via new regulations and case law. Requirements engineers and compliance auditors must be able to identify relevant regulations, extract requirements and other key concepts, and monitor compliance throughout the software lifecycle. This paper surveys research efforts over the past 50 years in handling legal texts for systems development. These efforts include the use of symbolic logic, logic programming, first-order temporal logic, deontic logic, defeasible logic, goal modeling, and semi-structured representations. This survey can aid requirements engineers and auditors to better specify, monitor, and test software systems for compliance.","2332-6441","978-0-7695-2935-6","10.1109/RE.2007.65","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4384161","","Law;Legal factors;Logic programming;Monitoring;Government;Information security;Legislation;Software systems;Computer science;Systems engineering and theory","","119","1","47","IEEE","19 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this experience paper, we explore a complementary application of legal requirements models, namely simulation. We observe that, in domains such as taxation, the same models that underlie legal compliance analysis bring important added value by enabling simulation. Concretely, this paper reports on the model-based simulation of selected legal requirements (policies) derived from Luxembourg's Income Tax Law.

This choice is carefully motivated and examples are given. Without attempting to reason about the document contents, a domain specific knowledge representation is used to form clusters of concepts. The point is to represent the joint structure of the component concepts involved in a composite concept. This approach extends the reach of key concept assignment to: interactive query elicitation; multiword phrase search; finer grained thesaurus relationships.

However, when exploring the practical meaning of this recommendation it becomes clear that people have different things in mind. The UK appeal court case R v T painfully exposes the different views. In this article we argue that there can be a trade-off between clarity and transparency, and that in some cases it is impossible for the legal practitioner to be able to follow the expert’s reasoning in full detail because of the level of complexity. All that can be expected in these cases is that the legal practitioner is able to understand the reasoning up to a certain level. We propose that experts should only report the main arguments, but must make this clear and provide further details on request. Reporting guidelines should address the reasoning in more detail. Legal practitioners and scientists should not be telling each other what to do in the setting of a legal case, but in other settings more discussion will be beneficial to both. We see the likelihood ratio framework and Bayesian networks as tools to promote transparency and logic. Finally, we argue that transparency requires making clear whether a conclusion is a consensus and reporting diverging opinions on request.","1470-840X","","10.1093/lpr/mgs017","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8157596","forensic science;evidence;transparency;forensic reporting;admissibility;inference","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Compared with general documents, legal case documents are typically long text sequences with intrinsic logical structures. However, most existing pre-trained language models (PLMs) struggle with understanding the long-distance dependencies between different sections within the complex structure of legal case documents. Another unique challenge in Taiwan Legal field is the lack of labeled datasets. This deficiency makes it difficult to accurately evaluate model performance. To date, models in Taiwan have yet to be specifically trained on legal case data. Given these challenges, this research aims to develop a model that can effectively understand and process long legal case documents and accurately retrieve similar legal cases. This research proposes a Longformer-LSTM model, Taiwan Legal Longformer, combining Longformer and LSTM in a sequenced manner. The Longformer, pre-trained on a Taiwanese legal case corpus, serves as the base model, processing input documents and generating context embeddings that capture local and global dependencies. These embeddings are then processed by the LSTM layer, adept at capturing long-distance dependencies in sequences. The model in this research is evaluated using our dataset and the Average Entropy of the Reason Clustering (AERC) metric, which is based on the assumption that case scenarios under the same reason of legal cases are similar. Compared with baseline models such as CKIP BERT Base Chinese and Longformer, our experimental results illustrate our model's advancements in handling similarity comparisons within extensive legal judgments.","","979-8-3503-0706-1","10.1109/WAIE60568.2023.00036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10496972","Legal Artificial Intelligence;Language Model;Computation and Language","Measurement;Law;Education;Propulsion;Predictive models;Natural language processing;Entropy","","","","26","IEEE","18 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We apply these frameworks to modelling a body of case law, explain how the frameworks can be generated to reconstruct legal reasoning in particular cases, and describe some tools to support the extraction of the value related knowledge required from a set of precedent cases.","1465-363X","","10.1093/logcom/exi058","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8211083","Argumentation;legal reasoning;practical reasoning;argumentation frameworks;argumentation schemes;critical questions;legal theory construction","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Its main aim is to process natural (human) language using computer programs. Text classification is one of the main tasks of this field, and they are widely used in many different applications such as spam filtering, sentiment analysis, and document categorization. Nonetheless, there is only very little text classification work in the law domain and even less for the Turkish language. This may be attributed to the complexity within the domain. The length, complexity of documents, and use of extensive technical jargon are some of the reasons that distinguish this domain from others. Similar to the medical domain, understanding these documents requires extensive specialization. Another reason can be the scarcity of publicly available datasets. In this study, we compile sizeable unsupervised and supervised datasets from publicly available sources and experiment with several classification algorithms ranging from traditional classifiers to much more complicated deep learning and transformer-based models along with different text representations. We focus on classifying Court of Cassation decisions for their crime labels. Interestingly, the majority of the models we experiment with could be able to obtain good results. This suggests that although understanding the documents in the legal domain is complicated and requires expertise from humans, it may be relatively easier for machine learning models despite the extensive presence of the technical terms. This seems to be especially the case for transformer-based pre-trained neural language models which can be adapted to the law domain, showing high potential for future real-world applications.","2768-7295","978-1-6654-9810-4","10.1109/INISTA55318.2022.9894051","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9894051","Legal document classification;Natural Language Processing;Domain-specific language models","Adaptation models;Technological innovation;Sentiment analysis;Law;Text categorization;Linguistics;Transformers","","7","","29","IEEE","23 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Modelling postglacial sea levels with power-law rheology and a realistic ice model in the absence of ambient tectonic stress","P. Wu",NA,Geophysical Journal International,"18 Jan 2018","1999","139","3","691","702","Previous studies of postglacial rebound with power-law rheology and simple ice models over Laurentia have found that sea-level data in the transition zone (e.g. Boston) cannot be easily explained unless non-linear rheology is restricted to lie within a thin layer between the lithosphere and the upper mantle. The reason is the existence of a viscously stationary zone, which is characteristic of non-linear mantles. In this study, the simple ice model is replaced by a realistic ice history adapted from the ICE-3G model, which takes into account important effects such as retreating ice margins and eustatic ocean loading. A 3-D finite element model is used to calculate the deformation and the relative sea levels in eastern Canada and along the US east coast. The purpose is to investigate whether the realistic load model allows sea-level data near the centre of rebound and along the Atlantic east coast of Canada and the USA to be explained by non-linear rheology simultaneously.The assumptions made are that: (1) postglacial rebound sees the steady-state creep and not the transient creep; (2) either ambient tectonic stresses do not interact with rebound stress or the ambient stress level is low; (3) lateral heterogeneity of rock properties and anisotropic flow can be neglected.Results indicate that the retreating ice margin does make it easier for non-linear rheology in the mantle to explain the sea-level data in the transition zone around Boston. However, reconciling all the sea-level data near the centre of rebound and along the Atlantic east coast simultaneously is still difficult for a non-linear rheology. So far, two types of models with non-linear rheology have been found to be able to explain the sea-level data inside and outside Laurentia simultaneously. They are: (1) earth models with a thin (≤270km) non-linear zone overlying a 1021 Pa s lower mantle; (2) earth models with a linear upper mantle with an average viscosity of 1021?Pa?s overlying a non-linear lower mantle with A*=3×10−35Pa−3s−1 and n=3.","1365-246X","","10.1046/j.1365-246x.1999.00965.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8139810","creep;finite element methods;glacial rebound;rheology;sea level;viscoelasticity;viscosity.","","","","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Especially in the judicial domain, it plays a significant role not only in enhancing the completeness of legal knowledge graphs but also in improving the accuracy of legal supervisory inference. Due to extensive legal expertise, complex entity relationships, and strict requirements for interpretable reasoning, traditional methods, such as embedding-based methods and those that utilize pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT), often fail to delve into deep semantic information or overlook the interconnections among triples, which leads to significant shortcomings in generalizability and capabilities in practical applications. Motivated by the great generation power of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a legal knowledge graph completion model based on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), which we have named RA-KG-LLM. This model effectively combines the generative capabilities of LLMs with retrieval-augmented technology to enhance the semantic information and interrelations mining within knowledge graphs. The retrieval framework within our model utilizes text embeddings and vector similarity matching to provide the LLM with relevant triples, while fine-tuning techniques are employed to infuse the semantic information from the knowledge graph into the LLM. Extensive experiments on five real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and potentiality in the judicial field of the proposed model. Specifically, on the legal domain dataset Cail2022, it achieves better Hits@1 score in the relation prediction task than the state-of-the-art related works.","","979-8-3503-9136-7","10.1109/DSC63484.2024.00033","Research and Development; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10859004","Large Language Models;Judicial Knowledge Graph;Knowledge Graph Completion;Retrieval-Augmented Generation","Law;Large language models;Retrieval augmented generation;Semantics;Knowledge graphs;Predictive models;Data models;Cognition;Vectors;Filling","","","","34","IEEE","4 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Prolog, a logic programming language with rule-based inference capabilities, presents an effective solution for automating such legal reasoning. In this paper, we construct an expert system that processes legal facts, applies relevant sections of Indian laws, and matches current legal cases to relevant prior judgments to deliver case-based legal decisions. The system incorporates key provisions from the IPC, such as sections dealing with theft, criminal offenses, and contract disputes, using legal precedents from landmark Indian cases to demonstrate its applicability.

GOF (goodness-of-fit) tests for the PLP have attracted much attention. However, the practical use of the PLP model is its graphical analysis or the Duane plot, which is a log-log plot of the cumulative number of failures versus time. This has been commonly used for model validation and parameter estimation. When a plot is made, and the coefficient of determination, R/sup 2/, of the regression line is computed, the model can be tested based on this value. This paper introduces a statistical test, based on this simple procedure. The distribution of R/sup 2/ under the PLP hypothesis is shown not to depend on the true model parameters. Hence, it is possible to build a statistical GOF test for the PLP. The critical values of the test depend only on the sample size. Simulations show that this test is reasonably powerful compared with the usual PLP GOF tests. It is sometimes more powerful, especially for deteriorating systems. Implementing this test needs only the computation of a coefficient of determination. It is much easier than, for example, computing an Anderson-Darling statistic. Further study is needed to compare more precisely this new test with the existing ones. But the R/sup 2/ test provides a very simple and useful objective approach for decision making with regard to model validation.","1558-1721","","10.1109/TR.2002.805784","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1179801","","Testing;Power system modeling;Regression analysis;Parameter estimation;Power system reliability;Systems engineering and theory;Failure analysis;Computational modeling;Statistics;Decision making","","35","","26","IEEE","19 Feb 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Such norm models help reason about available rights and required duties based on the satisfiability of situations, a state-of-affair, in a given scenario. But model extraction from natural language as well as compliance reasoning in complex scenarios needs subject matter expertise. Our method enables modular norm model extraction and reasoning. For extraction, using the theory of frame-semantics we construct two foundational norm templates that cover Hohfeld's concepts of claim-right and its jural correlative, duty. Template instantiations from legal text result in a repeatable method for extraction of modular norm models. For reasoning, we introduce the notion of a super-situation. Super-situations contain other norm models. Compliance results from a modular norm are propagated to its containing super-situation, which in turn participates in other modular norms. This modularity allows on-demand incremental modeling and reasoning using simpler model primitives than previous approaches.","","978-1-5386-1956-8","10.1109/DASC-PICom-DataCom-CyberSciTec.2017.115","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8328459","Frame semantics;Hohfeld rights;applicability;satisfiability;norms;laws;compliance","Law;Cognition;Semantics;Natural language processing;Analytical models;Privacy","","1","","24","IEEE","2 Apr 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study addresses the necessity for accurate and efficient personal credit risk assessment systems, focusing on rectifying credit data imbalances and developing a high-performing credit risk prediction model. To tackle data imbalance, deep learning’s Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is employed for oversampling, learning the distribution of default samples within high-risk financial groups. “New” default samples are then integrated into the original dataset to achieve a balanced representation of default and normal samples. In the era of big data, marked by a surge in personal credit data dimensions and sample numbers, an advanced ensemble learning model, the Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), is combined with the GAN model for credit risk prediction. The study utilizes six different imbalance ratio datasets from the Knowledge Extraction based on Evolutionary Learning platform to experiment with the GAN model’s classification effectiveness. Additionally, consumer finance company credit data, consisting of 559 features, undergoes data preprocessing and feature extraction to validate the LightGBM-GAN model’s effectiveness for credit risk prediction. Experimental results reveal that: (1) GAN significantly improves risk information classification (achieving an 86.7% accuracy), outperforming traditional oversampling methods on multiple datasets; (2) The LightGBM-GAN model excels in Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic values (averaging 0.86 and 0.87, respectively), establishing itself as an effective credit risk prediction model; (3) Feature importance identified by the LightGBM model underscores the predictive potential of financial weakly correlated variables, such as consumer behavior data. This study strives to equip financial institutions with efficient and precise credit risk assessment tools, ensuring compliance with laws and regulations, averting legal risks, reducing NPL risks, and fortifying the stability of the financial system.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3466192","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10689398","Risk assessment;risk prediction;legal prevention;generative adversarial network;light gradient boosting machine","Predictive models;Generative adversarial networks;Data models;Accuracy;Training;Generators;Risk management;Gradient methods","","","","35","CCBYNCND","23 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Degeneracies and scaling relations in general power-law models for gravitational lenses","O. Wucknitz",NA,Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,"19 Jan 2018","2002","332","4","951","961","The time-delay in gravitational lenses can be used to derive the Hubble constant in a relatively simple way. The results of this method are less dependent on astrophysical assumptions than in many other methods. For systems with accurately measured positions and time-delays, the most important uncertainty is related to the mass model used. Simple parametric models like isothermal ellipsoidal mass distributions seem to provide consistent results with a reasonably small scatter when applied to several lens systems. We discuss a family of models with a separable radial power law and an arbitrary angular dependence for the potential ψ=rβF(θ). Isothermal potentials are a special case of these models with β=1. An additional external shear is used to take into account perturbations from other galaxies. Using a simple linear formalism for quadruple lenses, we can derive H0 as a function of the observables and the shear. If the latter is fixed, the result depends on the assumed power-law exponent according to H0∝(2-β)/β. The effect of external shear is quantified by introducing a ‘critical shear’γc as a measure for the amount of shear that changes the result significantly. The analysis shows that in the general case H0 and γc do not depend on the position of the lens galaxy. Spherical lens models with images close to the Einstein radius with fitted external shear differ by a factor of β/2 from shearless models, leading to H0∝2-β in this case. We discuss these results and compare them with numerical models for a number of real lens systems.","1365-2966","","10.1046/j.1365-8711.2002.05426.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8159775","gravitational lensing;quasars: individual: Q2237+0305;quasars: individual: PG 1115+080;quasars: individual: RX J0911.4+0551;quasars: individual: B1608+656;distance scale","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

The proposed hybrid deep learning model addresses the growing complexities in contract compliance, legal disputes, and transactional analysis by combining the strengths of BERT for textual understanding and VAE for dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional structured data. The model was evaluated against nine existing models, including CNN, RNN, GRU, LSTM, Transformer, XGBoost, BERT, VAE, and Hybrid CNN-LSTM, using a dataset of 4318 data points consisting of B2B transactions, legal case studies, contracts, and compliance reports. The proposed HMTBA model achieved superior performance with an accuracy of 95.82%, precision of 93.72%, recall of 94.35%, and F1-score of 94.03%. This significant improvement over existing models demonstrates the potential of HMTBA to enhance legal risk management and improve contract compliance in B2B e-commerce.

While recent advancements in natural language processing have shown promise, existing approaches often struggle to capture the sophisticated interplay between facts, legal principles, and precedents that characterize legal decision-making. This paper introduces LegalReasoner, a novel multi-stage framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and integrates domain-specific knowledge for enhanced legal judgment prediction. Our approach encompasses four key stages: 1) legal knowledge infusion, where we pre-train an LLM on a vast corpus of legal literature using contrastive learning techniques; 2) case-law retrieval, employing a graph neural network to identify relevant precedents and statutes; 3) multi-hop reasoning, utilizing a transformer-based architecture with a hierarchical attention mechanism to navigate complex legal arguments; and 4) judgment synthesis, where we employ a generative adversarial network to produce coherent and legally sound judgments. We evaluate LegalReasoner on two diverse datasets: the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) cases and the Chinese AI and Law Challenge (CAIL2018). Our framework demonstrates substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average accuracy increase of 7.8% across all datasets. Furthermore, we conduct extensive ablation studies and interpretability analyses to elucidate the contributions of each component and provide insights into the model’s decision-making process. Our work not only advances the field of automated legal reasoning but also offers a transparent and explainable system that could serve as a valuable tool for legal professionals. By bridging the gap between AI and legal expertise, LegalReasoner paves the way for more efficient, consistent, and fair legal decision-making processes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3496666","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10750819","Legal judgment prediction;large language models;knowledge integration;multi-hop reasoning","Law;Cognition;Artificial intelligence;Predictive models;Natural language processing;Decision making;Large language models;Transformers;Contrastive learning;Knowledge based systems","","","","21","CCBYNCND","12 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The reasons for wanting to formalize the Law of Succession with the help of formal language and the creation of systems capable of inferring assumptions in situations with a high load of rules and restrictions are countless. Formalization improves the exact and specific understanding of a text because it helps highlight ambiguities, unintended readings or interpretations, increases accurate understanding and avoids misinterpretation of legal text arising from frequent amendments and revisions of legislation and jurisprudence. This results in an expansion of access to information, productivity growth, information qualification, better control of deadlines, increased efficiency and cost reduction.

Mostly a man with a need for judicial assistance approaches with an advocate to deal with his case, but this may not be useful when a person is interested in knowing and applying the exact law approach to petty issues in his life and also to avoid being a scapegoat at sometimes by few advocates who elongates the case system for his benefits. The proposed approach has an intelligent hybrid agent system composed of two subsystems, law gatherer and law decider to address the two key issues, finding out right laws and making a right choice. The law gatherer subsystem is based on the ontology web service architecture to define the ontology which is used for processing the semantic content of gathered law information. The law gatherer subsystem is composed of a knowledge system that combines Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and Rule-Based Reasoning (RBR). Simple Object Access protocol (SOAP) is used for establishing the communication interface and gathering XML-based contents between the agent system and the database system created, through remote procedure calls with condition parameters. In the second subsystem Law Decider, the Analytic Hierarchy Process which is a structured technique for dealing with complex decisions is used to make an optimal decision for satisfying the case structure of the individual. The proposed Hybrid agent system will assist the people with no judicial knowledge to feed their case details into the system to get the appropriate law suitable for that particular instance.","","978-1-4577-0878-7","10.1109/IAMA.2011.6049001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6049001","Intelligent Agent;Web Service;Ontology;Artificial Intelligence;Analytic Hierarchy Process;case-based reasoning;rule-based systems","Cognition;Equations;Mathematical model;Ontologies;Law;Database systems","","","","9","IEEE","20 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we re-analyze our previous data with the Kramer model including the pin-breaking dynamic pinning force (Fp) for a low field region. It is shown that the extrapolated upper critical field Bc2*, strongly depend on the ratio between the mean of the parameter Kp for Fp (<Kp>) and the parameter K, for the flux line lattice shearing pinning force Fs. It is found that the strain dependence of Fm at 4.2 K is approximately proportional to (Bc2*)1.5. We further compare the data with the prediction of our recent scaling theory based on Eliashberg theory of strongly coupled superconductors. It is shown that the strain dependence of Fm at 4.2 K is proportional to BC2 5/2 kappa-2, consistent with the temperature dependence of Fm.

However, for bigger models and/or models with mixed abundance of molecules, stochastic simulation fails to produce the required results in reasonable time. Parallel simulation can offer a solution for this challenge. Nevertheless, currently available parallel software tools either provide a coarse-grained parallelization or a general-purpose fine-grained parallel simulation of the well-known stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA). The former can only take advantage of parallel processing if multiple runs have to be performed, while the latter requires extensive synchronization and communication between the different processing nodes each time a reaction is to fire. In this paper, a fine-grained parallelization approach is presented that takes advantage of the underlying model semantics to improve the simulator performance.

We identify and measure the degree to which these models are unfair, deviating from legal equality by learning to associate different races with different legal contexts.","2375-9259","979-8-3503-8164-1","10.1109/ICDMW60847.2023.00037","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10411546","legal AI;large language models;case law;bias;fairness","Law;Conferences;Data models;Data mining;Task analysis;Standards;Context modeling","","","","74","IEEE","6 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

By adding MRAC law to the usual robust LQ control system, it is expected that the system output tracks to the reference signal even if there exist larger parameter perturbations that are not guaranteed in the robust LQ controller synthesis process. Through tracking to the reference signal, we expect that proposed system improves the robust control performance. The proposed system is synthesized by two-step approach. It is well known that if a controller is synthesized for a system with parameter perturbations, the tracking performance of the closed loop system is not as good as that of the closed loop with the nominal plant and a controller synthesized for the nominal plant. For this reason, a robust LQ controller is synthesized for a small perturbation, firstly. Then MRAC low is adopted for the closed loop with the plant and the robust LQ controller to improve the tracking performance when there exist large perturbations. LMI based stability analysis method for MIMO system is developed after Yang et al's method[6]. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by some experiments using a test-scale 2 Degree-of-Freedom (2DOF) helicopter.","","978-1-922107-63-3","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6613229","Robust LQ Control;Model Reference Adaptive Control;LMI analysis;Polytopic Uncertainties;MIMO Helicopter","Robustness;Uncertainty;Helicopters;Adaptation models;Stability analysis;Mathematical model;Propellers","","1","","8","","30 Sep 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we re-analyze our previous data with the Kramer model including the pin-breaking dynamic pinning force (Fp) for a low field region. It is shown that the extrapolated upper critical field Bc2 *, strongly depend on the ratio between the mean of the parameter Kp for Fp (<Kp>) and the parameter Ks for the flux line lattice shearing pinning force Fs. It is found that the strain dependence of Fm at 4.2K is approximately proportional to (Bc2 *)1.5.

A method to acquire finite state machines (FSM) from stakeholder rights and obligations for compliance monitoring is proposed. Rights and obligations define what people are permitted or required to do; these rights and obligations affect software requirements and design. The FSM allows stakeholders, software developers and compliance officers to trace events through the invocation of rights and obligations as pre- and post-conditions. Compliance is monitored by instrumenting runtime systems to report these events and detect violations. Requirements and software engineers specify the rights and obligations, and apply the method using three supporting tasks: 1) identify under-specifications, 2) balance rights with obligations, and 3) generate finite state machines. Preliminary validation of the method includes FSMs generated from U.S. healthcare regulations and tool support to parse these specifications and generate the FSMs.","","978-1-4244-8760-8","10.1109/RELAW.2010.5625358","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5625358","","Monitoring;Law;Semantics;Software;Privacy;Medical services","","5","","28","IEEE","9 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, since the radial scale at which strong lensing features are formed corresponds to the transition from the dominance of baryonic matter to dark matter, there is no known reason why galaxies should follow a power law in density. The assumption of a power law artificially breaks the mass-sheet degeneracy, a well-known invariance transformation in gravitational lensing which affects the product of Hubble constant and time delay and can therefore cause a bias in the determination of H0 from the time-delay technique. In this paper, we use the Illustris hydrodynamical simulations to estimate the amplitude of this bias, and to understand how it is related to observational properties of galaxies. Investigating a large sample of Illustris galaxies that have velocity dispersion σSIE ≥ 160 km s−1 at redshifts below z = 1, we find that the bias on H0 introduced by the power-law assumption can reach 20–50 per cent, with a scatter of 10–30 per cent (rms). However, we find that by selecting galaxies with an inferred power-law model slope close to isothermal, it is possible to reduce the bias on H0 to ≲ 5  per  cent and the scatter to ≲ 10  per  cent. This could potentially be used to form less biased statistical samples for H0 measurements in the upcoming large survey era.","1365-2966","","10.1093/mnras/stv2708","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8198313","gravitational lensing: strong;galaxies: haloes;galaxies: structure;cosmology: theory;dark matter","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

This paper highlights some observed limitations of current approaches and examines how adopting new automation strategies that leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) can help address these shortcomings and open up fresh opportunities. Specifically, we argue that the examination of (textual) legal artifacts should, first, employ a broader context than sentences, which have widely been used as the units of analysis in past research. Second, the mode of analysis with legal artifacts needs to shift from classification and information extraction to more end-to-end strategies that are not only accurate but also capable of providing explanation and justification. We present a compliance analysis approach designed to address these limitations. We further outline our evaluation plan for the approach and provide preliminary evaluation results based on data processing agreements (DPAs) that must comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

In this paper, we (a) present the challenges in training PIDL architecture, (b) contrast the performance of PIDL architecture in learning a first order scalar hyperbolic conservation law and its parabolic counterpart, (c) investigate the effect of training data sampling, which corresponds to various sensing scenarios in traffic networks, (d) comment on the implications of PIDL limitations for traffic flow estimation and prediction in practice. Case studies present the contrast in PIDL results between learning the traffic flow model (LWR PDE) and its diffusive variation. The outcome indicates that PIDL experiences significant challenges in learning the hyperbolic LWR equation due to the non-smoothness of its solution. Conversely, the architecture with parabolic PDE, augmented with the diffusion term, leads to the successful reassembly of the density data even with the shockwaves present.

Since most regulations are still written in natural language, support for the transformation of regulatory text into performance models is needed. This allows regulators and regulated parties to keep working with familiar natural language regulations and to use goal models indirectly while avoiding a potentially significant learning curve for goal-modeling techniques.

The construction of gravity sand retaining dams (hereinafter referred to as sand retaining dams) from the formation area to the circulation area is one of the quick and effective measures. Prevention and control projects often play a role in controlling the development trend of debris flow and reducing the size and frequency of debris flow. Debris flow will cause erosion and impact damage to the dam foundation of sand retaining dams. For the debris flow impact force, the most dangerous part is usually designed based on the largest impact force, while all parts of the dam body are designed according to the most dangerous part, which wastes materials. It's not economical. In this study, a debris flow gully is selected as the research model. Considering the interaction between debris flow and sand retaining dam, the impact simulation of debris flow on sand retaining dam was carried out. The research results show that the existence of the sand retaining dam hinders the movement process of debris flow, changes its speed and direction of movement, and in addition, the impact force varies at different places of upstream face of sand retaining dam. Research results provide a scientific and reasonable theoretical basis and design reference for the stability of sand retaining dam under debris flow impact impact.

Also if the cloud industry is aware of this legislation/regulation compliance issue (e.g. the compliance program of Amazon, Google and Microsoft Azure), right now, there are no mechanism/architectures capable to check and to assure that the compliance is guaranteed during the whole life cycle of a cloud service, off-line and at run-time.

Furthermore, liability, right and performance transition through run-time operations such as subcontracting, assignment and substitution complicate contract interpretation. Automation is needed to ensure that contracts respect desirable properties and to support monitoring of compliance and handling of violations. In this thesis research, I propose an innovative ontology that defines fundamental contractual notions (such as the ones mentioned above) and their relationships, on which is built a specification language, called Symboleo, that provides syntax and axiomatic semantics of contracts via first-order logic.

This paper introduces Variability-Aware Legal-GRL (Goal-oriented Requirements Language) framework for modeling compliance requirements in the presence of runtime changes. We extend the Goal-oriented Requirements Language (GRL) with new elements and model construction rules to model context-aware privacy policies for dynamic multi-jurisdictional domains as well as features for monitoring changes that trigger adaptation. We motivate and illustrate the proposed framework using Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA) statements.

Although the ML method is laborious and numerically sensitive, this article favors ML over LS for a drastic reason that only ML can estimate the general coefficient of variation, but it still recommends using both the methods for some other reasons.

The intersection of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and law holds potential to transform how legal professionals, including lawyers and judges, operate, resolve disputes, and retrieve case information to formulate their decisions. To identify the current state of the applications of Transformers (also known as Large Language Models or LLMs) in the legal domain, we analysed the existing literature from 2017 to 2023 through a database search and snowballing method. From 61 selected publications, we identified key application categories such as legal document analysis, case prediction, and contract review, along with their main characteristics. We observed a discernible upsurge in the volume of scholarly publications, a diversification of tasks undertaken (e.g., legal research, contract analysis, and regulatory compliance), and an increased range of languages considered. There has been a notable enhancement in the methodological sophistication employed by researchers in practical applications. The performance of models grounded in the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) architecture has consistently improved across various legal domains, including contract review, legal document summarization, and case outcome prediction. This paper makes several significant contributions to the field. Firstly, it identifies emerging trends in the application of LLMs within the legal domain, highlighting the growing interest and investment in this area. Secondly, it pinpoints methodological gaps in current research, suggesting areas where further development and refinement are needed.

Initial results from the few-shot learning experiment illustrate the model’s preliminary ability to interpret and process regulatory texts with limited examples. Fine-tuning enhances model performance by training it on a specialized dataset, thereby improving structural and textual accuracy. Progressive active learning, by iteratively incorporating expert feedback, further refines the accuracy of the model.

However, its integration within the sector is accompanied by significant legal and regulatory challenges, necessitating a nuanced understanding of compliance frameworks. This paper delves into the intricate relationship between AI applications in finance and the regulatory environment governing them. We explore the current regulatory landscape, identifying key areas of concern such as data privacy, ethical use of AI, transparency, and accountability. Through a comprehensive literature survey, we highlight the evolving nature of regulatory guidelines across different jurisdictions and the implications for stakeholders in the financial ecosystem. Our proposed work introduces a novel framework designed to assist financial institutions in navigating these complexities, ensuring that AI applications are developed and deployed in a manner that is compliant with existing and foreseeable regulatory requirements. The framework is underpinned by algorithms that facilitate compliance checks and risk assessments, incorporating mathematical models to predict regulatory alignment and potential breaches. We present the implementation of our framework through a series of case studies, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing compliance processes. Results are analyzed using graphs and tables to illustrate the impact of our approach on regulatory adherence. The conclusion underscores the importance of proactive regulatory engagement and the adoption of sophisticated compliance tools in harnessing the full potential of AI in finance.","","979-8-3503-5968-8","10.1109/ICKECS61492.2024.10616752","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10616752","Artificial Intelligence;Financial Regulation;Compliance Framework;Risk Assessment;Ethical AI","Ethics;Navigation;Law;Ecosystems;Finance;Mathematical models;Complexity theory","","1","","15","IEEE","7 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We can call it XML vocabulary on law and it suggests also a convention of giving name for providing unique identifier to legal sources based on FRBR mode. There is no effort has been made to create standard representation of law in India. The subject matter of the paper goes into detail of creation of standard representation of parts of RTI Act 2005 for its implementation under a given circumstances. The process model of second appeal was undertaken. It was found that majority of RTI appeals at CIC are returned only for the reason that rule 8 and 9 of the RTI Act has not been fulfilled. The study captured the process of filing second appeal and created a schema of representation of various components and system prototype to check the compliance before accepting second appeal. The schema was created using subset of AKOMA-NTOSO schema, XML & HTML standard. The result shows that quality of services are improved by eighty percent(80%) and it has the potential to augment the way to create schema for entire RTI ACT. There are challenges associated with complexities in judicial system and quality of encoding of law on the basis of schema created and development of system to act accordingly.

The long-standing practice based on the IEC ‘second summation law’ has been called into question by observations on single-phase AC string inverters at a US solar farm site. Many practitioners therefore advocate a conservative approach where no diversity in current phase angles is assumed and current magnitudes are purely additive. In this paper, a straightforward analysis of data collected by a solar inverter OEM is offered as evidence that the IEC summation law provides realistic estimates of aggregate harmonic currents from solar farms, and conversely, there is a reasonable likelihood that the conservative approach leads to inefficient design and unnecessary costs.","","978-1-6654-7164-0","10.1109/ETFG55873.2023.10408521","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10408521","Harmonic distortion;Power conversion harmonics;Power system harmonics;Power quality;Solar power generation","Power measurement;Current measurement;Aggregates;Power system harmonics;Harmonic analysis;Mathematical models;Optimization","","","","8","IEEE","2 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Three mathematical characteristics of tonal music melody are found based on music composition theory. The constrained entropy maximization model (CEMM) is constructed, and the power-law distribution of melodic intervals is the result of solving the problem formulated in this model. Three other typical power-law models in economics, linguistics/informatics, and design of complex engineering systems are reviewed, and their goal orientation behaviors are analyzed. It is found that the models quantifying different social behaviors with goal orientation are consistent with the unified model. The power law is actually the result of the well-known social distribution mechanisms with limited resources, such as the maximal wealth with limited economic capability, the minimal cost under constrained resources, and the maximal entropy with restrictions. If without limit or constraint, these social systems would not observe the power law.

With was formerly different, in this paper, we propose a cell-gridded 3D network model in which movement and distribution of nodes follow Zipf’s law with exponent $\varphi$ (many scholars have proved this law to conform to the movement law of the actual world). Moreover, our model can cover a variety of distribution scenarios with changes in $\varphi$ value. We derived the packet delivery rate and network throughput capacity scaling law under the two-hop relay routing algorithm with the help of Zipf’s law and classical capacity analysis theories and discussed the impact of $\varphi$ on capacity. Additionally, our research findings indicate that if we can fully utilize network users’ movement and distribution status information in different areas and reasonably divide network cells, it will be expected to improve network throughput capacity performance.","","978-1-6654-9508-0","10.1109/ICTC55111.2022.9778767","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9778767","3D-MANET;Throughput capacity;Zipf’s law","Solid modeling;Analytical models;Three-dimensional displays;Throughput;Routing;Probability distribution;Communications technology","","1","","14","IEEE","23 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this issue, a novel named entity recognition approach for legal instruments based on improved few-shot learning is introduced in this paper. This approach enables named entity recognition of a large amount of unknown legal data with a small amount of annotated data on legal instruments. Firstly, data augmentation is employed to expand the training sample, and a BERT pre-training model is used to obtain word vectors of the text data. Subsequently, the NNshot model is applied to learn text data features and perform classification. Then, a Viterbi decoder based on label-pair rules is used to capture the dependencies between categories, correct the NNshot prediction results, and select the optimal classification sequence. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed named entity recognition method is reasonably reliable and can overcome the challenge that entities cannot be accurately recognized due to insufficient annotation data.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3484765","Fundamental Research Funds for the Provincial Universities of Zhejiang(grant numbers:RF-C2023007); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10731673","Named entity recognition;legal instruments;data augmentation;Viterbi decoder;improved few-shot learning","Hidden Markov models;Law;Vectors;Instruments;Viterbi algorithm;Data models;Training;Games;Decoding;Data augmentation","","","","48","CCBYNCND","23 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, both the government and farmers' actions and strategies during rural land-use right transfers are analyzed in the sight of government regulations by use of the game theory with construction and analysis of a game-theoretic model of rural land-use right transfers between them. It believes that a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium will exist between the government and farmers during rural land-use right transfers and their strategies are interdependent.

For-profit enforcement is considered to be one possible reason for this phenomenon. This causality is articulated using an evolutionary model. There are two types of agents in this model, the first type is civilians who are bounded rational, and decide on whether to abide a law by learning from each other in a short time horizon; the other type is the law enforcement agency, who has higher rationality, and will choose optimal inspection frequency and punishment strength to maximize their payoff in a long time horizon, with the knowledge of how the civilians update their strategies. It is revealed that, if the enforcement agency can obtain benefit from the fines collected in the enforcement, their optimal choice is not to enforce the law strictly, but to adopt a moderate inspection frequency and punishment strength, because this induces more civilians to violate the law and brings the agency higher income. However, this intended lenient enforcement leads to a pervasive law-violation in the society.","2639-4235","978-1-7281-5857-0","10.1109/ICCSS48103.2019.9115444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9115444","Evolutionary game theory;Pervasive law-violation;For-profit law enforcement;Fine;Discretion abuse","","","","","13","IEEE","12 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Firstly, this paper discusses the classification and constraints of traffic laws on vehicle states, outlining five principles for legal driving. Subsequently, law-compliance potential fields are established, incorporating factors related to roads, obstacles, and vehicle speeds. The potential fields-based model predictive control (MPC) controller is then employed to generate feasible trajectories, thereby enabling legal driving. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified through three representative scenarios including the intersection, the highway and the urban road.

This paper introduces CHRExpert, an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven legal assistant designed to support law practitioners in analyzing judicial decisions and predicting case outcomes. Utilizing a Pretrained Generative Transformer (GPT) with 6 billion parameters, fine-tuned on the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) dataset, CHRExpert automates legal document analysis by identifying key legal provisions, performing statutory interpretation, and applying analogical reasoning to suggest legal strategies. The system is designed to support practitioners in aligning their legal arguments with judicial reasoning, particularly in post-litigation analysis. Evaluations based on final judgments demonstrated an accuracy of 83% in predicting outcomes for cases involving Articles 3, 6, and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, with an average AUC of 0.93. Additionally, CHRExpert reduced the time required for case preparation by 40%, streamlining legal workflows and improving efficiency. This paper demonstrates the potential practical application of AI to enhance legal processes by offering accurate predictions and experiential insights, making it a valuable tool for human rights litigation.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3547763","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10909511","AI legal assistant;human rights litigation;transformer models;GPT-J;case outcome prediction;legal document analysis","Law;Transformers;Artificial intelligence;Mathematical models;Europe;Decision making;Accuracy;Vectors;Encoding;Vocabulary","","","","46","CCBY","4 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Since most legal data are presented in text, using natural language processing (NLP) to solve legal question answering is a current research direction. Compared with traditional question answering tasks, legal question answering often contains some potential information, such as legal events, crime process, litigants, and victims. This potential information suggests the legal question answering model reasoning's theme and can help the model improve its reasoning ability. In addition, the legal question answering task must answer based on relevant legal clauses, and the number of relevant legal clauses is usually a lot. Hence, the model needs to eliminate the influence of redundant and noisy clauses. Therefore, we propose a double-granularity-based graph neural network that can reason through potential legal events. Based on this research, we design an attention mechanism based on text interaction and calculate the attention by different window sizes score to decrease the influence of noise graph nodes. Finally, we evaluate the proposed model on the JEC-QA benchmark dataset to demonstrate our method's effectiveness. Experimental results show that the model performs well on the Chinese legal examination data and outperforms classical baselines. Out-performs the best baseline model by 7.08 in overall performance and outperforms the best baseline model in single-choice and multiple-choice questions; they are 7.52 and 6.41, respectively.","2161-4407","978-1-6654-8867-9","10.1109/IJCNN54540.2023.10192015","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10192015","Graph neural network;Double-granularity;Legal Question Answering","Adaptation models;Law;Scalability;Benchmark testing;Question answering (information retrieval);Cognition;Graph neural networks","","","","29","IEEE","2 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years, there have been reports of breaches of personal data either from organizations that collected it or from mischievous third parties. The global responses against the breaches have been the enactment of various policies and regulations to protect personal data against all forms of potential abuses. Nigeria Data Protection Regulation was also issued as the regulatory framework for personal data and privacy protection on Nigerian soil. This paper, aimed at analysing the state of compliance of Ministries, Departments, and Agencies with the regulatory framework. An online questionnaire was designed and hosted on Google Forms. The link to the questionnaire was sent to 110 staff, selected based on convenience, and representing various Ministries, Departments, and Agencies. The results have shown that about 70% of the organizations were aware of the provision of Nigeria Data Protection Regulation but only 34% indicated that they started the implementation. Nonetheless, about 45% Ministries, Departments, and Agencies completed the preparatory stage of compliance as they indicated that they have conducted detailed audits on their organizational operations to determine the changes and the new practices required to comply with the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation. The surveyed organizations indicated 37% to 60% compliance with other components of Nigeria Data Protection Regulation. The paper concluded that more advocacy and enforcement are required to speed up compliance with regulations.","","978-1-6654-9370-3","10.1109/ITED56637.2022.10051182","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10051182","Personal data;privacy protection;data protection regulations","Computers;Education;Data protection;Organizations;Soil;Telephone sets;Regulation","","1","","19","IEEE","2 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Conventional document retrieval systems involve the matching of a query against individual documents, whereas a clustered search compares a query with clusters of documents, thereby achieving efficient retrieval. In most document databases periodic updating of clusters is required due to the dynamic nature of a database. Experimental evidence, however shows that clustered searches are substantially less effective than conventional searches of corresponding non-clustered documents.

Most existing studies have considered task dependencies while neglecting the prior dependencies of labels among different tasks. Therefore, how to make better use of the information on the relation dependencies among tasks and labels becomes a crucial issue. To this end, we transform the text classification problem into a node classification framework based on graph reasoning and supervised contrastive learning (SCL) techniques, named GraSCL. Specifically, we first design a graph reasoning network to model the potential dependency structures and facilitate relational learning under various graph topologies. Then, we introduce the SCL method for the LJP task to further leverage the label relation on the graph. To accommodate the node classification settings, we extend the traditional SCL method to novel variants for SCL at the node level, which allows the GraSCL framework to be trained efficiently even with small batches. Furthermore, to recognize the importance of hard negative samples in contrastive learning, we introduce a simple yet effective technique called online hard negative mining (OHNM) to enhance our SCL approach. This technique complements our SCL method and enables us to control the number and complexity of negative samples, leading to further improvements in the model’s performance. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on two well-known benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness and rationality of our proposed SCL approach as compared to the state-of-the-art competitors.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2023.3344634","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61802121); Natural Science Foundation of Hunan Province, China(grant numbers:2022JJ30159,2023JJ20013); China Scholarship Council(grant numbers:202206130103); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10378955","Graph reasoning;legal judgment prediction (LJP);supervised contrastive learning (SCL)","Task analysis;Law;Cognition;Topology;Learning systems;Network topology;Transformers","","","","57","IEEE","1 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, current autonomous vehicles prioritize safety and collision avoidance primarily in their decision-making and planning, which will lead to misunderstandings and distrust from human drivers and may even result in accidents in mixed traffic flow. Therefore, ensuring the compliance of the autonomous driving decision-making system is essential for ensuring the safety of autonomous driving and promoting the widespread adoption of autonomous driving technology. To this end, the paper proposes a trigger-based layered compliance decision-making framework. This framework utilizes the decision intent at the highest level as a signal to activate an online violation monitor that identifies the type of violation committed by the vehicle. Then, a four-layer architecture for compliance decision-making is employed to generate compliant trajectories. Using this system, autonomous vehicles can detect and correct potential violations in real-time, thereby enhancing safety and building public confidence in autonomous driving technology. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated on the DJI AD4CHE highway dataset under four typical highway scenarios: speed limit, following distance, overtaking, and lane-changing. The results indicate that the proposed method increases the vehicle's overall compliance rate from 13.85% to 84.46%, reduces the proportion of active violations to 0%, and only slightly decreases the vehicle's traffic efficiency by 2.7%, demonstrating its effectiveness.","2379-8904","","10.1109/TIV.2023.3318214","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52072215,U1964203); National key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFB2503003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10261280","Autonomous vehicles;road traffic law;decision-making;model predictive control","Law;Decision making;Safety;Trajectory;Road transportation;Planning;Autonomous vehicles","","3","","28","IEEE","22 Sep 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Extracting structured relationships between entities in legal texts can significantly enhance our understanding of legal concepts and facilitate the creation of knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose a structured approach combining relation extraction, graph reasoning, and clustering methods to effectively extract and represent legal relationships. Firstly, we employ state-of-the-art relation extraction techniques to identify relevant entities and their relationships from unstructured legal documents. These techniques leverage natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to recognize entity pairs and assign appropriate relationship labels. Next, we leverage graph reasoning to enhance the extracted relationships by incorporating additional contextual information. By representing the legal entities and their relationships as nodes and edges in a knowledge graph, we can apply reasoning algorithms to infer implicit relationships, resolve conflicts, and expand the graph based on the legal domain’s rules and regulations. Furthermore, we integrate clustering methods to organize related legal entities and relationships into meaningful clusters within the knowledge graph. By grouping semantically similar entities and relationships, we can uncover patterns, identify common themes, and enable more effective retrieval and analysis of legal information. Our experiments demonstrate that the structured approach, combining relation extraction, graph reasoning, and clustering methods, effectively extracts and represents legal relationships in a knowledge graph. The resulting graph provides a comprehensive and organized representation of legal concepts, facilitating legal research, decision-making, and knowledge discovery in the legal domain.","","979-8-3503-0525-8","10.1109/GCAT59970.2023.10353444","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10353444","Relation extraction;Knowledge graph creation;Legal documents;Graph reasoning;Clustering methods;Natural language processing;Machine learning","Machine learning algorithms;Law;Clustering methods;Decision making;Knowledge graphs;Cognition;Natural language processing","","1","","23","IEEE","19 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing works analyze the scaling law of epidemic protocol based on the assumption that each node has the same infectivity. Whereas, the most recent work indicates that the distribution of infected nodes has spatial-temporal correlation rather than homogeneity, i.e., nodes in different locations have different infectivities, which leads to defectiveness of the existing solutions. In this paper, by exploring the reason behind this difference, we try to relax the assumption and rebuild the model for epidemic routing. We first introduce the concept of infection rate to reflect the infectivity of infected nodes. Second, we propose an effective method to compute the average infection rate and use it to derive a generic scaling law. Third, we give an explicit expression for the generic scaling law, which provides us with upper bound. We finally compare our model with the existing works through theoretical analysis and simulations. The results show that our model has a closer match than those of the existing works and gets some insights into the spatial distribution of infection process.","1558-2612","978-1-4673-0437-5","10.1109/WCNC.2012.6214305","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6214305","Scaling law;Epidemic protocol;Infection rate;Delay tolerant networks","Routing;Mathematical model;Simulation;Analytical models;Distribution functions;Protocols;Computational modeling","","3","","15","IEEE","11 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In time domain, through this simulate system, user can design and adjust the control law for separation aircraft. Considering the inertia of control system, the real time aerodynamics is delayed for control system. At the same time, control surfaces' deflection angle and angle velocity saturation are considering. The result of simulation indicated that the generic control law for aircraft flight is not suit to controlling separation. The reason for this phenomena is severity unsteady interfere aerodynamics action on separation aircraft.

Moreover, the result of term of penalty is closely related to the seriousness of the circumstance.

To address these problems, we present a sequential multi-task learning framework with task Dependencies and label Constraints for Legal Judgment Prediction (DCLJP).

A new class of challenges threatens the ability of logic vendors to gain competitive advantage by migrating to 45 nm, 32 nm, and below. Achieving the required time to market with economically acceptable yield levels and maintaining them in volume production has become a daunting task in the most advanced technology nodes. One of the primary reasons is the relative increase in process variability in each generation. In the older technology generations, manufacturing yield loss was dominated by random defects. This situation started to change rapidly at the 130 nm technology node in which product layout systematic effects became more critical. More recently, due to challenging product performance requirements and increased process variability, parametric yield losses have become significant as well.","2156-017X","978-1-4244-2377-4","10.1109/IEDM.2008.4796711","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4796711","","Moore's Law;Peer to peer computing;Costs;Circuits;Design methodology;Design optimization;Process design;MOS devices;Logic;Time to market","","2","","","IEEE","27 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It arises from perceptions or prejudices about the characteristics of a group, or the roles individuals should play in society. This bias can significantly impact the reasoning or outcomes of legal processes, such as judicial rulings. To ensure equal treatment for all individuals, it is crucial to effectively reduce this bias. The first step to reduce bias is to define approaches that can identify manifestations of gender bias. However, these manifestations are not usually easily detectable in text (e.g., through keywords) as they often require detailed contextual analysis, typically done manually by experts. This paper addresses this issue by leveraging natural language processing and machine learning techniques to automate parts of the analysis. Specifically, it proposes a processing pipeline based on text embeddings, binary classification, and the use of large language models (LLMs) to explain classification results. An initial evaluation on a set of judicial rulings shows promising results in terms of precision and recall, along with qualitative insights into the potential of these techniques in the legal domain.","2771-5752","979-8-3315-4097-5","10.1109/CLEI64178.2024.10700116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10700116","Natural Language Processing;Text Classification;Judicial Rulings;Gender bias;LLMs","Law;Large language models;Pipelines;Machine learning;Natural language processing;Cognition","","","","0","IEEE","8 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The manufacturing process of ETS used an electrolytic copper plating method to form copper foil pattern coated on carrier board, and then multi-layers of ETS structure will duplicate the same process flow to been made, such as laser via drill, electro-less copper plating, dry-film lamination, exposure and development, next layer plating of copper pattern, stripping after removing carrier board, micro etching to enhance adhesion with solder mask, and metal treatment of surface finish after process of solder mask opening. Different to traditional build-up process, the trace width of ETS structure would not be attacked during process of micro etching, and the wall structure formed by dry-film between traces can prevent solder bridge problem of copper pillar bump during process of flip chip bond (FCB) [1]. Manufacturing process of ETS must go through a sequential high-temperature and -pressure step, thus the approach to construct a complex and detailed model is so far engineer's objective for accurate prediction. When the assumption of stress-free at single curing temperature even though the chemical shrinkage has be considered is challenged, manufacturing temperature-independent model could not match well with experimental measurements because they don't include an integrated processing modeling methodology. In particular, temperature-dependent material properties and different stress-free temperatures for different materials in the same model were considered in order to model the sequential steps during the sequential fabrication of high-density electronic packaging structures. However, the effort on fundamental study usually makes an impossible work due to time-and manpower-consuming, thus the mission has been transferred to construct an effective and simple approach on thermo-mechanical analysis. In this study, the material modeling has been simply constructed on elastically temperature-dependence for polymeric material utilized in packaging extensively. Furthermore, the innovative concept of conservation laws also has been developed on stress constitutive model; meanwhile, the creative ideology, such as cross-linking induced residual strain (εRS) from compound forming and process-induced stress field, further has been embedded. Others, the experimental vehicles also have been performed for a reasonable simplification at single stress-free temperature of substrate, besides measurements were scheduled to confirm the accuracy on warpage. As comparison, these two different warpage modeling methodologies, including processing model and non-processing model, of an encapsulated integrated circuit (IC) package, associated with different schemes of a sequential manufacturing process, were analyzed. The results indicate if elastically stress constitutive model is: (1) constructed on stress conservation law with temperature-dependent property; (2) considered at single stress-free temperature respectively for compound and substrate; and (3) involved the effect of residual strain from compound forming, the numerical solutions were agreed well with measured data. Finally, the capability to save computation for effective material property of laminated substrate has been tested and indicated that material property in in-plane direction can be treated as homogeneous by rule of mixture, especially for temperature below the glass transition temperature (Tg) of PP.","","978-1-5386-7668-4","10.1109/EPTC.2018.8654292","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8654292","ETS;thermo-mechanical analysis;elastically temperature-dependence;conservation laws;residual strain;single stress-free temperature of substrate","Strain;Stress;Temperature measurement;Substrates;Copper;Integrated circuit modeling;Lamination","","","","11","IEEE","28 Feb 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, these technologies remain in their early stages and face challenges such as understanding complex legal reasoning, managing biased data, ensuring transparency, and avoiding misleading responses, commonly referred to as hallucinations. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Legal Query RAG (LQ-RAG), a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework with a recursive feedback mechanism specifically designed to overcome the critical shortcomings of standard RAG implementations in legal applications. The proposed framework incorporates four key components: a custom evaluation agent, a specialized response generation model, a prompt engineering agent, and a fine-tuned legal embedding LLM. Together, these components effectively minimize hallucinations, improve domain-specific accuracy, and deliver precise, high-quality responses for complex queries. Experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned embedding LLM achieves a 13% improvement in Hit Rate and a 15% improvement in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). Comparisons with general LLMs reveal a 24% performance gain when using the Hybrid Fine-Tuned Generative LLM (HFM), the specialized response generation model integrated into the LQ-RAG framework. Furthermore, LQ-RAG achieves a 23% improvement in relevance score over naive configurations and a 14% improvement over RAG with Fine-Tuned LLMs (FTM). These findings underscore the potential of domain-specific fine-tuned LLMs, combined with advanced RAG modules and feedback mechanisms, to significantly enhance the reliability and performance of AI in legal practice. The reliance of this study on a proprietary model as the evaluation agent, combined with the lack of feedback from human experts, highlights the need for improvement. Future efforts should focus on developing a specialized legal evaluation agent and enhancing its performance by incorporating feedback from domain experts.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3542125","Institute of Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation (IITP); Korea Government (MSIT) (IITP-2025-RS-2021-II210118, Development of decentralized consensus composition technology for large-scale nodes); IITP (Institute of Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation)-ITRC (Information Technology Research Center); Korea Government [Ministry of Science and Information and Communication Technology (ICT)](grant numbers:IITP-2025-RS-2021-II211835); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10887211","Retrieval-augmented generation;legal query;LLM agent;information retrieval","Law;Retrieval augmented generation;Accuracy;Tuning;Semantics;Hybrid power systems;Adaptation models;Training;Reliability;Mathematical models","","","","63","CCBY","14 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although excessive healthcare regulation is a bad thing, regulatory compliance may bring with it many benefits, such as market entry, product quality and availability, as well as access to tax rebates and financial incentives. Goal-oriented regulations, in particular, embody in their formulation specific propositions to maximize compliance benefits provided the achievement of public policy goals. In this paper, we develop an in-depth study of goal-oriented healthcare equipment regulations. We use expert knowledge and process-mining techniques to investigate what goes on with regulatory compliance and with the benefits obtained by equipment manufacturers when the healthcare equipment regulation is goal-oriented. We present here a multi-company exploratory case study on the variability of mean times-to-benefit after compliance and on regulatory process improvement, focused on the diagnostic imaging equipment segment and the regulatory context in Brazil. We show that, in some cases, mean times-to-benefit depend on the compliance of different categories of diagnostic imaging equipment with technical requirements found in the applicable norms. Moreover, we present process improvement cases elicited during goal-oriented regulatory process analysis and modeling activities. Our study illustrates the usefulness of applying expert knowledge and process mining techniques together in the healthcare equipment domain. It also suggests that healthcare equipment product-management practices should be concerned not only with analyzing and ensuring regulatory compliance but also with regulation dynamics.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2982031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9043557","Diagnostic imaging equipment;regulatory requirements;goal-oriented regulation;healthcare processes;public policy","Medical services;Regulation;Imaging;Public policy;Analytical models;Economics;Finance","","","","25","CCBY","20 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Two specific challenges commonly faced by non-experts are deciding if their system is covered by a law, and then deciding whether two legal requirements are similar or different. In this study, we assess the ability of laypersons, technical professionals, and legal experts to judge the similarity between legal coverage conditions and requirements. In so doing, we discovered that legal experts achieved higher rates of consensus more frequently than technical professionals or laypersons and that all groups had slightly greater agreement when judging coverage conditions than requirements, measured by Fleiss' K. When comparing judgments between groups using a consensus-based Cohen's Kappa, we found that technical professionals and legal experts exhibited consistently greater agreement than that found between laypersons and legal experts, and that each group tended towards different justifications, such as laypersons and technical professionals tendency towards categorizing different coverage conditions or requirements as equivalent if they believed them to possess the same underlying intent.","2332-6441","978-1-4799-3033-3","10.1109/RE.2014.6912269","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6912269","legal requirements;compliance;statutory interpretation;legal coverage","Law;Training;Standards;Mobile communication;Companies","","6","","39","IEEE","29 Sep 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The STF’s justices frequently cite the 58 existing BPs in their decisions, and it is of primary relevance that judicial experts could identify and analyze such citations. To assist in this problem, we propose LegalVis, a web-based visual analytics system designed to support the analysis of legal documents that cite or could potentially cite a BP. We model the problem of identifying potential citations (i.e., non-explicit) as a classification problem. However, a simple score is not enough to explain the results; that is why we use an interpretability machine learning method to explain the reason behind each identified citation. For a compelling visual exploration of documents and BPs, LegalVis comprises three interactive visual components: the first presents an overview of the data showing temporal patterns, the second allows filtering and grouping relevant documents by topic, and the last one shows a document’s text aiming to interpret the model’s output by pointing out which paragraphs are likely to mention the BP, even if not explicitly specified. We evaluated our identification model and obtained an accuracy of 96%; we also made a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the results.

Allocating reasonable attention to these elements related to the penalty is the key to improving the effect of the penalty prediction. To this end, we propose a novel model called MHA-AR which learns to focus on the key elements by a modulated hierarchical attention mechanism and a legal attribute recognition subtask. Besides benefiting the prediction accuracy, it also improves the reliability and credibility of predictions for users by providing comprehensible legal attributes related to the penalty. A series of experiments conducted on the real-world datasets demonstrate the correctness of our assumptions and the superiority of MHA-AR.

These technologies generate large amounts of user data that provide opportunities for organisations to improve the quality of their user services. The publication of user-generated data creates risks for exposing an individual’s privacy. In the literature, identity theft and attribute disclosure are the two most common attacks on user-generated data. These privacy issues require data publishing organisations to protect user privacy. International regulatory standards provide consistent frameworks and guidelines that data publishing organisations can use to secure user-sensitive data. This survey discusses the characterisation and quantification of user privacy in compliance with international regulatory standards. We provide an overview of existing regulations and frameworks related to user privacy, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and implications for individuals and businesses. We discuss the steps involved in characterising and quantifying user privacy within the framework of international regulatory standards, privacy tools, and real-world case studies. Furthermore, we share promising directions for future research and development, including advancements in privacy techniques, interdisciplinary collaborations, and the role of emerging technologies.

Most previous work modeled LQA as a retrieval task, which could obtain irrelevant answers due to the limitations of pre-constructed databases. In addition, it is costly to maintain an up-to-date database as legal knowledge is constantly being updated. To address these issues, we propose the Generation-based Method for Legal Question Answering (GLQA). GLQA instead models LQA as a generation task to flexibly produce new relevant answers specific to each question. To further make the answers more controllable and informative, GLQA incorporates laws as external knowledge into the answer generation process. Specifically, our method contains a retriever and a generator. The retriever is used to retrieve applicable law articles as external knowledge and the generator aims to generate answers with the help of external knowledge. The retriever and the generator are integrated into a single T5 model using multi-task learning to make them mutually reinforcing. Our design enables the model not only to produce highly relevant new answers but also to keep the knowledge in the answers up-to-date by modifying the law database at a low cost.","2161-4407","978-1-6654-8867-9","10.1109/IJCNN54540.2023.10191483","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10191483","Legal question answering;Knowledge-enhanced text generation;Multi-task learning;Sentence embeddings","Costs;Law;Databases;Neural networks;Process control;Multitasking;Question answering (information retrieval)","","1","","39","IEEE","2 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It can provide wider range of spectra to describe the random rough surfaces than other spectra. Based on the proposed spectrum, backscattering of soil surfaces is studied by using the integral equation model (IEM). The simulation results are compared with the experimental measurements of real soil surfaces at L, C, and X bands for the different roughness scales and moisture conditions.

These infrastructures introduce multifaceted challenges in legal, ethical, financial, and technological (LEFT) domains, highlighting the critical need for a comprehensive framework to navigate the complexities within these domains and facilitate successful implementation. This viewpoint paper presents version 1.0 of a roadmap for eHealth implementation concerning LEFT domains and provides a preliminary overview of key preconditions essential for successful implementation. The roadmap is constructed based on the LEFT barriers and facilitators identified in an earlier study, systematically translating these insights into specific preconditions for successful implementation. Legal preconditions emphasize the necessity of effective data privacy and security measures, along with a comprehensive regulatory compliance framework. Ethical preconditions focus on facilitating patient understanding and control, enhancing consent processes, and implementing robust validations mechanisms for eHealth technologies. Financial preconditions advocate for fostering public-private stakeholder collaboration, establishing a financially sustainable business model, and developing eHealth reimbursement strategies. Technological preconditions include promoting interoperability between different data systems, enhancing data and system quality, and improving usability and accessibility of eHealth technologies. While this paper introduces version 1.0 of the roadmap and outlines the LEFT preconditions for eHealth implementation, effective implementation also requires collaborative decision-making among multidisciplinary stakeholders. Recognizing the need for a holistic approach, these preconditions necessitate careful consideration and systematic planning, with the roadmap serving as guidance to address the challenges of creating a successful eHealth infrastructure.","","979-8-3503-5054-8","10.1109/HealthCom60970.2024.10880735","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10880735","implementation;eHealth;ethical;financial;business model;stakeholder engagement","Ethics;Systematics;Law;Navigation;Decision making;Collaboration;Data systems;Electronic healthcare;Planning;Stakeholders","","","","13","IEEE","18 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The primary aim of the studies was to measure the effects of a poster's textual (plain, unambiguous written message or pun) and visual features (incongruent or congruent picture) on health care workers' attention to the poster, their attitude towards the poster, their comprehension of the message, and their compliance. Both studies were conducted in a natural setting at a care organization. In total, 193 health care workers participated. The results of the first study showed that a poster with a plain written message and a congruent picture has the most favorable effects on compliance. The results of the second study showed no differences between a poster with a pun and with one with an explicit message; both have favorable effects on compliance.

Whilst we focus upon legal principles for decision making in discretionary legal domains, our goal is to develop theory for constructing legal decision support systems. Our jurisprudential theory is hence applied to a practical legal domain—namely the distribution of marital property following divorce in Australia.

Most warehouses arrange routes for circulation along the shelves, transportation vehicles will move on this road to perform the task of exporting or importing goods. Routes will be arranged to move in one direction because vehicles do not have enough space to turn around in cramped warehouses. This causes many difficulties in planning the trajectory for transportation vehicles, especially self-propelled vehicles. In order to have an appropriate transportation plan, it is necessary to solve many problems, including: reasonable transport equipment, sufficient number of devices, optimal route layout, algorithm of operation center for Positioning and Navigation of transportation equipment. This study proposes a method for transportation using an omnidirectional automated guided vehicle (AGV). The AGV's omnidirectional mobility is supported by the mecanum wheels, so vehicles can move in multiple directions on the road without turning, even at a junction or an intersection. This study consists of two parts, the first part focuses on kinematic modeling for mecanum wheels and extends to robot’s platform using four mecanum wheels.

Recently, interest in the Barkhausen effect has grown as it is a good example of dynamical critical scaling behavior, evidenced by experimental observation of a power law distribution of the Barkhausen jump size. So far, most experimental studies have been carried out on bulk samples using a classical inductive technique, which is difficult to apply to thin film samples mainly due to the low signal intensity. For this reason, very few experiments have been done on two-dimensional ferromagnetic thin films. In this talk, I will report direct domain observations of Barkhausen avalanches at criticality in Co and MnAs nanothin films investigated by means of a magnetooptical microscope magnetometer, capable of time-resolved domain observation in real time. Through a statistical analysis of the fluctuating size of Barkhausen jump from numerous repetitive experiments for each sample, the distribution of Barkhausen jump size is found to exhibit a power-law scaling behavior with the critical exponent τ ∼ 1.33 for all samples having different thickness from 5 to 50 nm. The most striking feature is the fact that the τ values are in the same universality class for all samples within the measurement error despite of the difference in the film thickness. This result implies an invariance of the critical exponent τ irrespective of the number of defects in the thin films. Our experimental results directly verify the CZDS model, where the model describes 180°-type flexible domain wall deformed by localized defects with consideration of long-range dipolar interaction.","","0-7695-2189-4","10.1109/ICMENS.2004.1508927","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1508927","","Transistors;Magnetic materials;Deformable models;Physics;Nanostructured materials;Magnetoelectronics;Materials science and technology;Magnetization;Magnetooptic effects;Magnetic force microscopy","","","","6","IEEE","19 Sep 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The design methodology aims at a well-matched system with a maximized power-transfer efficiency for mid-range applications. The system consists of two identical resonant coils driven by high-quality factor loops. The proposed design criteria allows obtaining maximum achievable transfer efficiency and impedance matching at any defined distance without any external matching circuits connected to the driven loops. For validation purposes, a printed WPT system at 10 MHz is fabricated targeting 1-m distance between the transmitting and receiving sides. Its performances in terms of reflection and transmission coefficients, as well as in terms of generated electric and magnetic fields, have been characterized numerically and experimentally. The impact of human body presence on the system has also been investigated observing the splitting in two frequencies of the common resonant frequency of the coils. A dosimetric study has been conducted using a detailed high-resolution anatomical human body model and considering E99, J1 cm2, and specific absorption rate (SAR) (local and whole body averaged SAR) as exposure metrics. It has been observed that peak exposure levels appear in different tissues depending on the body location. Compliance with the international commission on nonionizing radiation protection (ICNIRP) reference level as well as basic restrictions has been studied followed by computing the maximum allowable input power. It has been found that, with the body located 1 m away from the transmitting coil, the maximum allowable input power satisfying E99 is in the order of MW, whereas it reduces to tens of kilowatt when considering SAR and J1 cm2. The latter has been noticed to be the most restrictive dosimetric quantity.","1557-9670","","10.1109/TMTT.2016.2609931","French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES) (Expo-WPT project)(grant numbers:EST-2013/2/005); French National Research Agency (ANR) (WIREFREE project)(grant numbers:ANR-14-CE26-0030-01); French National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7583637","Dosimetry;exposure assessment;mid-range applications;printed technology;wireless power transfer (WPT)","Coils;Design methodology;Magnetic resonance;Impedance matching;System analysis and design;Microwave theory and techniques","","24","","30","IEEE","5 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

"Impact of environmental regulations on control of copper ion concentration in the DIII-D cooling water system","A. M. Gootgeld","General Atomics, San Diego, CA, USA",15th IEEE/NPSS Symposium. Fusion Engineering,"6 Aug 2002","1993","2","","958","961 vol.2","Tokamaks and industrial users are faced with the task of maintaining closed-loop, low conductivity, low impurity, cooling water systems. Operating these systems concentrates the impurities in the water requiring subsequent disposal. Environmental regulations are making this increasingly difficult. This paper will discuss the solution to the problem of removing and disposing of copper ions in the DIII-D low conductivity water system. Since the commissioning of the Doublet facility in 1976, the quality of the water in the 3000 gpm system that cools the DIII-D vacuum vessel coils, power supplies and auxiliary heating components has been controlled with mixed-bed ion exchangers. Low ion levels, particularly copper, are required to operate this equipment. In early 1992, the company that leases and regenerates DIII-D ion exchangers said they no longer can accept these resin beds for regeneration due to the level of copper ion an the resin. This change in policy, a change that has been adopted throughout their industry, was necessary to assure that the Metropolitan Sewerage System of the City of San Diego stays in compliance with State of California regulations end EPA-mandated national pre-treatment standards and regulations. A cost effective solution was implemented which utilizes a reverse osmosis filtration system with the ion exchangers for make-up water. Levels of copper ion disposed to the sewer are in compliance with government standards. These measures have thus far proved effective in maintaining low conductivity and overall good quality cooling water. Specifically, this paper discusses DIII-D deionized cooling water quality requirements and an effective means to meet these requirements in order to be in compliance with government regulations for copper ion disposal. The problems discussed, the alternatives considered and the approach taken would be readily applicable to any deionized cooling water system containing copper where EPA standards and regulations are mandated.","","0-7803-1412-3","10.1109/FUSION.1993.518484","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=518484","","Copper;Cooling;Conductivity;Impurities;Resins;Government;Tokamaks;Electrical equipment industry;Vacuum systems;Coils","","2","","1","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Unrestricted legal advice, such as attorney-client communication or litigation strategy, is exempt from disclosure in litigation or regulatory events and is vital to the attorney-client relationship. To protect this information from disclosure, companies and outside counsel must review vast amounts of documents to determine those that contain privileged material. This process is costly and time consuming. As data volumes increase, legal counsel employs methods to reduce the number of documents requiring review while balancing the need to ensure the protection of privileged information. Keyword searching is a popular method to target privileged information and reduce document review populations. Keyword terms are effective at casting a wide net but generally return overly inclusive results – most of which do not contain privileged information. To overcome the weaknesses of keyword searching, legal teams have started using supervised learning techniques to more precisely target privileged information. However, reviewing and labeling training documents is costly and time intensive and may cause counsel to forego the use of supervised learning in certain scenarios. In addition, supervised learning techniques may not find all the privileged documents in a document review and require companies to use keyword terms to identify critical privileged information. In this paper, the authors propose a novel method to automatically identify privileged documents without the need to label new training documents. This method integrates rule-based reasoning with transfer learning. Experimental results show that the proposed integrated method performs better than rule-based reasoning and transfer learning individually and can effectively identify privileged documents.","","978-1-6654-8045-1","10.1109/BigData55660.2022.10020392","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10020392","Text classification;Rule-based reasoning;Transfer learning;E-Discovery;ediscovery;Legal document review","Training;Law;Transfer learning;Supervised learning;Keyword search;Text categorization;Companies","","2","","7","IEEE","26 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our application of Hadoop MapReduce in conjunction with a number of algorithms, such as clustering, classification, word count, word co-occurrence, and row similarity, is encouraging, in that the results are robust enough to suggest these approaches have promise and are worth pursuing. By utilizing larger case data sets and sample sizes and by using deep machine learning models in text analytics, more breakthroughs can be achieved to provide decision support to the legal domain. From an economic standpoint, the potential for litigation cost reduction is another objective of our study. Synergies are obtained in applying lessons to the computational field and vice versa, leading to acceleration in our understanding.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2859052","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8418375","Big data analytics;Hadoop MapReduce;legal decision making;machine learning;pharma patent validity","Patents;Law;Drugs;Technological innovation;Decision making","","12","","67","OAPA","23 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most of the existing work does not distinguish circumstances in law articles, and uses the entire law article as a whole. In order to make finer-grained reasoning, we consider law articles at circumstance level. As descriptions of circumstances may depend on some other circumstances, we construct a circumstance-based law article graph (CLAG) reflecting the dependencies between circumstances in order to create better representations for them.

In this paper, we describe an approach to upgrade legacy industrial applications based on the IEC61131 function block model without the need to redesign the whole application. The approach that integrates the 3+1 SysML-view model with safety engineering is adopted and is tailored to the needs of upgrading legacy applications.

The synthesized guidance law addresses a wide range of constraints, with a primary focus on reducing sensitivity to the initial guidance error, resulting in lower required acceleration command at the initial homing phase. Incorporating an input weighting function effectively distributes the guidance command throughout the homing phase. Simultaneously, the guidance law ensures compliance with the terminal impact angle and field-of-view (FOV) constraints. To meet the FOV constraint, the paper integrates a saturation function mapping method. The guidance law ensures that the acceleration command approaches zero at the terminal phase, achieving precise control of the impact angle. Furthermore, the missile’s trajectory generated by this guidance law remains unaffected by variations in missile velocity, enhancing its applicability in real-world scenarios. Numerical simulations are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the synthesized guidance law.","2475-7896","979-8-3503-2878-3","10.1109/ICCAIS59597.2023.10382396","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10382396","guidance law;impact angle;field-of-view;optimal error dynamics","Missiles;Sensitivity;Automation;Shape;Numerical simulation;Trajectory","","","","17","IEEE","10 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents an in-depth study of Brooks' law using the system dynamics simulation approach. Unlike the first-order approximation of Brooks' law, we found some interesting results that can benefit practicing project managers. We found that adding people to a late project will always increase its cost, but the project may not always be late. Only under a certain degree of sequential constraints among the project tasks will the project be delayed. To investigate the impact of sequential constraints, we simulated numerous task conditions and found that there is a time-line T for each project which means that, if enough manpower is added before T, the project still can finish before the scheduled deadline. If the manpower adjustment is after T, then the project will definitely be late. In this way, Brooks' law is revised and turned into a useful guiding principle to benefit software development.","0730-3157","0-7695-0368-3","10.1109/CMPSAC.1999.814310","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=814310","","Electrical capacitance tomography;Delay;Scheduling;Costs;Programming;Postal services;Financial management;Software development management;Technology management;System testing","","7","","6","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we describe a case study in which we asked graduate-level software engineering students to assess whether a set of software requirements for an electronic health record system met or exceeded their corresponding legal obligations as expressed in regulations created pursuant to the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). We compare the assessment made by graduate students with an assessment made by HIPAA compliance subject matter experts. Additionally, we contrast these results with those generated by a legal requirements triage algorithm. Our findings suggest that the average graduate-level software engineering student is ill-prepared to write legally compliant software with any confidence and that domain experts are an absolute necessity. Our findings also indicate the potential utility of legal requirements metrics in aiding software engineers as they make legal compliance decisions.","2332-6441","978-1-4577-0924-1","10.1109/RE.2011.6051661","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6051661","legal requirements;requirements metrics","Law;Measurement;Software engineering;Software systems;Complexity theory","","11","1","34","IEEE","20 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These methods often infer many erroneous regulations. In order to decrease the number of erroneous regulations, this study uses a priori knowledge that biochemical networks exhibit hierarchical structures. This study detects the hierarchical structure in the target network using a hierarchical random graph model proposed by Clauset and colleagues. When the regulations inferred by the inference method are inconsistent with the detected hierarchical structure, we can conclude that they are unreasonable. However, it is not always easy to detect the hierarchical structure in the target network because of the regulations erroneously inferred by the inference method. In order to obtain a reasonable hierarchical structure, this study first infers a large number of genetic networks from the observed gene expression data by using a method that combines a genetic network inference method with a bootstrap method. We then extract a hierarchical structure from the inferred multiple genetic networks so that it is consistent with most of the networks. Through numerical experiments, we finally show that the use of the hierarchical structure in the network improves the reliabilities of regulations inferred by the genetic network inference method.","2161-4407","978-1-4799-1960-4","10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280362","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7280362","","Reliability;Periodic structures;Search problems;Genetics;Time measurement","","","","15","IEEE","1 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While conducted noise is well covered in the literature, the radiated noise is not. Regulations about radiated noise impose limits in the noise measured three or ten meters far away the electronic equipment. These measurements are usually made in anechoic rooms, which are a very expensive equipment, and the measurement procedure is not a «plug-and-play» feature, but a carefully protocol of measurement is required. Once the electronic circuit has been tested, in case the regulation was not met, the designer unknowns the source of the problem, so the procedure to make the electronic circuit to comply with the regulation used to be a trial-and-mistake method, when the experience of the designer is essential. A new radiated noise measurement technique is proposed in this paper with two objectives: to simplify the measurement procedure and to have more information about the noise sources. The main idea is to scan the electric/field at two arbitrary but known distances. From these measurements, the Source Reconstruction Technique (SRT) allows the identification of the noise sources in the surface of the circuit and the field estimation at any distance, so that the regulation compliance can be evaluated. Moreover, if the regulation is not satisfied, the effect of the noise source modification can be tested, to find how the circuit must be modified to comply with the regulation.","2163-5145","978-1-4244-0754-5","10.1109/ISIE.2007.4375008","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4375008","","Noise measurement;Electromagnetic interference;Power electronics;Circuit noise;Circuit testing;Electronic circuits;Electronic equipment;Protocols;Electronic equipment testing;Surface reconstruction","","8","","6","IEEE","5 Nov 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Cyber law and espionage law as communicating vessels","A. Lubin","Post-Doctoral Cyber Research Fellow, Tufts University, Medford, MA, United States",2018 10th International Conference on Cyber Conflict (CyCon),"9 Jul 2018","2018","","","203","226","Existing legal literature would have us assume that espionage operations and ""below-the-threshold"" cyber operations are doctrinally distinct. Whereas one is subject to the scant, amorphous, and under-developed legal framework of espionage law, the other is subject to an emerging, ever-evolving body of legal rules, known cumulatively as cyber law. This dichotomy, however, is erroneous and misleading. In practice, espionage and cyber law function as communicating vessels, and so are better conceived as two elements of a complex system, Information Warfare (IW). This paper therefore first draws attention to the similarities between the practices - the fact that the actors, technologies, and targets are interchangeable, as are the knee-jerk legal reactions of the international community. In light of the convergence between peacetime Low-Intensity Cyber Operations (LICOs) and peacetime Espionage Operations (EOs) the two should be subjected to a single regulatory framework, one which recognizes the role intelligence plays in our public world order and which adopts a contextual and consequential method of inquiry. The paper proceeds in the following order: Part 2 provides a descriptive account of the unique symbiotic relationship between espionage and cyber law, and further explains the reasons for this dynamic. Part 3 places the discussion surrounding this relationship within the broader discourse on IW, making the claim that the convergence between EOs and LICOs, as described in Part 2, could further be explained by an even larger convergence across all the various elements of the informational environment. Parts 2 and 3 then serve as the backdrop for Part 4, which details the attempt of the drafters of the Tallinn Manual 2.0 to compartmentalize espionage law and cyber law, and the deficits of their approach. The paper concludes by proposing an alternative holistic understanding of espionage law, grounded in general principles of law, which is more practically transferable to the cyber realm.","2325-5374","978-9-9499-9043-6","10.23919/CYCON.2018.8405018","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8405018","international law;information warfare;espionage;cyber law;Tallinn Manual 2.0;sovereignty;diplomatic law;consular law;general principles of law","Law;Convergence;Manuals;Malware;Cyberattack;IP networks","","5","","","","9 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Namely, assuring compliance with the duty-cycle limit, the maximum Tx time and minimum Tx-off time limit. Such a solution has not been researched mostly due to the popularity of the virtually world-wide 2.4 GHz ISM band which at present does not impose duty-cycle limitations. The wireless sensor networks (WSNs) operating in the 868MHz band have their own niche applications that benefit from the increased signal range. The development and the acceptance of such applications will benefit from the existence of the proposed module implemented in firmware/software.

"Towards locally appropriate electric vehicle hosting capacity regulations","J. Dippenaar; B.

To ensure power quality standards are adhered to, network planners and policymakers need to develop EV hosting capacities that guide EV-grid integration. This paper focuses on the practical implementation of EV hosting capacity regulations in various political and social contexts. There is a growing body of literature on EV hosting capacities informed by load flow simulations; these studies typically define the EV hosting capacity as the percentage of households that can install an EV charger before the grid becomes constrained. However, little attention has been given to the practical implementation of these hosting capacities. The way in which EV hosting capacities are defined and enforced has a major impact on both the uptake of EVs as well as the potential to overwhelm grid infrastructure. There are a range of legal mechanisms to implement EV hosting capacities, and these can range from “hard laws” that limit EV charger capacities through legally binding instruments to “soft laws” that utilize tariff-based incentives to shift EV loads to times when the grid has available capacity. Our hypothesis is that a range of factors should influence the design of locally appropriate EV regulation. These criteria may include the history of regulatory compliance in that customer segment, the technical capacity of the grid operator, and the urgency of implementation. The contribution of this paper is to initiate the development of a decision framework to guide the policymakers design locally appropriate EV hosting capacity regulations. The eventual decision framework will be of relevance to network planners and policymakers that are developing regulations to manage the uptake of EVs on their networks.","","978-1-83953-705-9","10.1049/icp.2022.0781","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9841945","","","","","","","","27 Jul 2022","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Clustering analyses conducted previously also suggest that clustering and its related techniques can be of value to legal practitioners, legislators, and auditors in devising remedial intervention strategies to curb all forms of corporate law violations.

However, a semi-automatic strategy, which can ensure the basic quality requirements of a knowledge graph, has been successfully implemented in the elementary science domain. This paper presents a semantic annotation system developed for building a high-quality legal knowledge graph (SALKG) using the semi-automatic strategy. We introduce its system design, architecture, algorithms, functions, and implementation. To investigate the effectiveness of SALKG, we conduct a preliminary annotation experiment with 280 legal texts which were collected from the Harvard Caselaw Access Project. The user evaluation from 32 graduate students demonstrates the high usability of SALKG in semantic annotation and the potential for building a high-quality legal knowledge graph.

"Assessing GPT's Legal Knowledge in Japanese Real Estate Transactions Exam","K. Inoshita","Faculty of Data Science, Shiga University, Hikone, Japan","2024 International Conference on Innovation and Intelligence for Informatics, Computing, and Technologies (3ICT)","13 Jan 2025","2024","","","149","155","In recent years, large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, developed by OpenAI, have demonstrated impressive capabilities in tasks such as natural language understanding, code generation, and even passing professional exams. Trained on vast datasets, these models have shown high accuracy across various fields. One challenging area for LLMs is professional certification exams, which require specialized knowledge and understanding of complex regulations. The Real Estate Transaction Specialist Examination (RETSE) in Japan is a key certification for professionals managing real estate transactions. Passing the RETSE qualifies individuals to handle legal responsibilities like ensuring the legality of property deals. The exam covers civil law, tax law, and real estate regulations, making it a comprehensive test of legal knowledge. With a pass rate of around 15%, it is considered one of Japan's more difficult professional exams, making it a strong benchmark for evaluating LLM performance. This study evaluates the ability of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 to answer RETSE questions, comparing their performance to official passing criteria and analyzing the effect of prompt engineering. While GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5, neither model met the passing standard. Prompt strategies such as “Consider customary laws” improved response accuracy, especially for complex legal questions. These findings suggest that while GPT models cannot fully replace human expertise in legal exams like RETSE, they offer potential as supplementary learning tools for verifying basic knowledge. To mitigate the risk of job displacement by AI, it is crucial for professionals to enhance their expertise in areas where LLMs struggle, such as recent legal changes and ethical judgment. This study highlights both the limitations and potential of GPT in legal contexts, providing insights into how AI can support learners and practitioners in real estate law.","2770-7466","979-8-3315-3313-7","10.1109/3ict64318.2024.10824669","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10824669","GPT;Legal Knowledge Assessment;Real Estate Transactions;Prompt Engineering;AI in Education","Ethics;Technological innovation;Accuracy;Law;Large language models;Regulation;Natural language processing;Prompt engineering;Certification;Standards","","","","20","IEEE","13 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The ability to predict a person’s facial appearance from a DNA sample may generate important investigative leads and provide an unprecedented advancement in criminal investigations. To achieve the above goal, it is first essential to substantiate, model and measure the intrinsic relationship between the genomic markers and phenotypic features. In the first step, we have standardized the 3D face scans using a widely used 3D data format - CoMA. The standardization was followed by its projection into a low-dimensional latent embedding space. The second step was to reduce the dimensionality of the genetic space. The dimensionality reduction was achieved by performing Principal Component Analysis on the genomic markers to generate compact genomic properties. A simple multi-layer perceptron was trained to classify an ensemble of facial embeddings and genomic properties into genuine and imposter pairings. The classification model could match the DNA with the given 3D face with an average Area Under the Curve score of 0.73. The introduction of hand-picked genomic markers was an important contribution toward improving the final AUC score. Furthermore, results indicated that incorporating additional phenotypical properties such as sex and age leads to better verification. Thus, this study represents an important milestone toward building a functional machine learning pipeline capable of predicting facial appearance and other visible traits from a DNA sample.","","978-1-6654-9402-1","10.1109/WI-IAT55865.2022.00114","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10102080","dimensionality reduction;spiral convolution;biometric verification;fusion network","Deep learning;Solid modeling;Three-dimensional displays;Pipelines;Genomics;DNA;Data models","","1","","14","IEEE","24 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The method assesses the reliability of evidences at first, and then fuses them with D-S combination evidence theory to draw a final conclusion. The paper expands how to use the method with an example. There are three kinds of evidences in a law case: witness, circumstantial evidence, and authentication, with the introduction of D-S combination theory, three evidences are fused, and then the reliability of the final decision can be assessed.","","978-0-7695-3543-2","10.1109/WKDD.2009.67","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4772004","law case;evidence theory;reliability","Reliability theory;Law;Legal factors;Fuses;Testing;Data mining;Laboratories;Educational institutions;Authentication;Auditory system","","1","","7","IEEE","2 Feb 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The main reasons for an accident is Rash-Driving and Violation of traffic rules. And also sometimes due to malfunctioning of our vehicle. Due to this more deaths and injuries are occurring. In recent days IOT, sensors, Artificial Intelligence, and Machine Learning are changing this world in many aspects. It provides solutions to many problems in this world in an easy and efficient manner. In order to control and prevent the accident we have proposed a Smart System using Raspberry Pi, Ultrasonic Sensor, Light Color Detection Sensor and Speed Governor system which has to be incorporated in vehicles. The main aim of our project is to develop an Automatic Speed Control System based on the type of road (i.e. whether the road is national highway or state highway or streets etc.‥) in order to prevent accidents and reduce the number of people who die as a result of them. In the present vehicle conditions, various vehicles are out and about, run by the driver who doesn't hold any legitimate permit(driving license), despite the fact that it is difficult to get the drivers license. Accordingly a framework can be created which will act to control these issues, prior to starting the vehicle, by making certain safety efforts. The vehicle should start provided that the genuine driving permit holder is driving that specific vehicle else the vehicle won't start, by this way we can getentrance over the non driving permit holders to drive the vehicle and stay away from frightful traffic circumstances. This can be done by using a Face Recognition Module installed inside the vehicle. This also indirectly acts as a security system and reduces theft of vehicles.","","978-1-6654-7995-0","10.1109/IC3IOT53935.2022.9767919","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9767919","IoT;Artificial Intelligence;Machine Learning;Raspberry Pi;Blockchain;Sensors(Ultrasonic Sensor;Light Color Detection Sensor);Speed Governor System;Face Recognition","Road traffic;Velocity control;Color;License plate recognition;Sensor systems;Telecommunication computing;Security","","1","","16","IEEE","12 May 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Considerable research has been conducted on the legal issues related to artificial intelligence. Herein, taking 621 papers indexed by Thomson Reuters’s Web of Science as the object, the basic status of research on legal issues related to artificial intelligence was analyzed using the quantitative and visual analysis method. In terms of the research field, the results showed that the research on legal issues related to artificial intelligence shows interdisciplinary characteristics, that is, the legal issues related to artificial intelligence not only attract scholars in the legal field, but also those in computer science, engineering, social sciences, library and information science, business economics and other fields. In terms of keyword cooccurrence and cluster analysis, it was found that the legal issues related to artificial intelligence mentioned in these papers can be mainly divided into the following three categories: the first is the positive impact of artificial intelligence on practice of law, involving legal services, law enforcement, legal analysis (e.g., legal reasoning, legal argumentation), etc.; the second is the practical challenges possibly arising from artificial intelligence, including the determination of criminal responsibility, the governance of discrimination or bias risks, and the protection of copyright, privacy, and data rights; and the third is the regulatory solutions for artificial intelligence mainly focusing on ethical regulation, legislative regulation, technical regulation.","","979-8-3503-0696-5","10.1109/CEII60565.2023.00031","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10506882","Artificial Intelligence;Legal Issues;Informetric Analysis","Ethics;Visualization;Law;Social sciences;Production;Regulation;Libraries","","","","27","IEEE","25 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The authors present HELIC-II, a legal reasoning system on the parallel inference machine. HELIC-II draws legal conclusions for a given case by referring to a statutory law (legal rules) and judicial precedents (old cases). This system consists of two inference engines. The rule-based engine draws legal consequences logically by using legal rules. The case-based engine generates legal concepts by referencing similar old cases. These engines together draw all possible conclusions, and output them in the form of inference trees. Using these inference trees HELIC-II can support arguments in a legal suit. HELIC-II can draw conclusions quickly by parallel inference.<>","","0-8186-3840-0","10.1109/CAIA.1993.366619","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=366619","","Law;Legal factors;Counting circuits;Artificial intelligence;Search engines;Natural languages;Inference algorithms;Machine intelligence","","","","5","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Foreign research shows that the construction of the legal system has an important role in the constraints to the controlling shareholders expropriation. By empirical analysis on the Chinese listed companies which conducted equity transfer in A-share markets of Shanghai and Shenzhen during 2000-2005, this article draws the conclusion that the perfection of legislation can effectively restrict controlling shareholders' expropriation. The stronger the application of law enforcement, the higher the controlling shareholders' violating standard to the investors' interests. The reason may be that although the whole legislation environment was improving during 2000-2005, yet the legislation shortage in some specific areas resulted in the increase of law enforcement cost, and eventually got little effect with improving law enforcement. This shows that China should continuously perfect its legislation in various specific areas in the improvement of overall legal environment.","2155-1472","978-1-61284-450-3","10.1109/ICIII.2011.407","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6116878","corporate governance;private benefits of control;controlling shareholders;law and finance theory","Legislation;Companies;Law enforcement;Economics;Finance","","","","13","IEEE","29 Dec 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

They calibrated these models in the field with the support of National Grid, which operates in the UK and on the US East Coast. The model shows that optimal choices are subject to phase transitions: depending on the combination of incentives, operators will stop investing in risk assessment and only care about compliance (and vice versa). This finding suggests that different approaches might be more appropriate in different conditions and that just pushing for more rules could have unintended consequences.","1558-4046","","10.1109/MSP.2016.48","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7478546","cybersecurity;regulations;economics;grid;infrastructure;privacy;security","Computer security;SCADA systems;Standards;Economics;Computer architecture;Malware","","6","","17","IEEE","25 May 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

We show that this discrepancy is a natural consequence of the fact that the isophote eccentricity varies with the radius of the isophote and present a mathematical transformation that allows the minor axis Sérsic model to be calculated from the major axis model, provided that the elliptical isophotes are aligned and concentric and that their eccentricity can be represented by a well behaved, though quite general, function of the radius. When there is no variation in eccentricity only the effective radius changes in the Sérsic model, while for radial-dependent eccentricity the transformation, which allows the minor axis Sérsic model to be calculated from the major axis model is given by the Lerch Φ transcendental function. The proposed transformation was tested using photometric data for 28 early-type galaxies.","1365-2966","","10.1111/j.1365-2966.2004.07254.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8161803","galaxies: fundamental parameters;galaxies: photometry;galaxies: structure","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Universities offer Internet services to users, store personal information of learners, staff, conference and attendees. which exposes them to potential risks and legal liabilities. Failure to ensure compliance with information security laws poses significant financial and reputation risk and may invite serious scrutiny of university activities by law enforcement bodies [24]. While universities have sought various measures to achieve compliance (e.g. self-regulations, security policies, staff/student handbooks, public relation campaigns, Web and email reminders and audits.), these have had limited success in influencing user behaviours. The rate of electronic abuse and lack of compliance with policies is simply on the rise. The August 2009 EDUCAUSE Review indicates that security remains one of the top strategic issues facing higher education institutions [2]. [20] claims that half of all personal identity breaches occur in higher education. The recording industry and motion picture associations are increasingly holding institutions liable for illegal downloading of copyright materials [11] and students have also been accused of privacy violations [8]. So, what makes compliance with policies and regulations in universities difficult and how can compliance be measured and achieved effectively? This study examines the factors that influence compliance with security policies and regulations in universities. First, some key regulations governing information security in South Africa are introduced, followed by a review of the security environment and compliance behaviours in universities. A framework aligning regulatory requirements with control standards is developed to guide compliance behaviours in universities.","2330-9881","978-1-4244-5495-2","10.1109/ISSA.2010.5588651","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5588651","IS security compliance;security regulations & policies;universities;control frameworks","Law;Information security;Privacy;Standards;Planning","","3","","26","IEEE","30 Sep 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Baigent","London, UK; London, UK",IEEE International Engineering Management Conference,"10 Dec 2002","2002","2","","837","841 vol.2","The value attached to intellectual property, particularly patents, has been rapidly increasing. The recognition, development and exploitation of intellectual property is now a central factor in technology management. However, in the field of electronics in particular, there is a natural tension between two objectives: on the one hand, protecting market share by carving out clear proprietary positions; and, on the other hand, growing the market through industry-wide acceptance for new technologies, particularly by having the technology accepted as standard. The general requirement imposed on companies that participate in formal standards-setting is that they must give an undertaking to the standards body to offer licences to essential intellectual property on terms that are fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory. Any patentee that has been involved in standards-setting, and which later seeks to license or litigate related patent rights, inevitably faces arguments about this requirement. The position is further complicated by the international legal landscape. In the European Union, it is often argued by potential infringers that the patented technology is an ""essential facility"", access to which (it is argued) must be granted under EU competition law. Patentees, however, view this as a form of compulsory licensing. There is much that the technology manager can do to plan a successful route, guiding the development of technology projects through the complex interrelated network of law, business practice, and technology. It is important to plan technical developments so as to create a balanced portfolio of essential and nonessential rights, framed around appropriate products and methods, and to ensure that third party use of the rights can be effectively controlled and policed in a manner that benefits the technology and the business.","","0-7803-7385-5","10.1109/IEMC.2002.1038547","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1038547","","Intellectual property;Navigation;Law;Technology management;Licenses;Consumer electronics;Industrial electronics;Protection;Electronics industry;Standards organizations","","","","","IEEE","10 Dec 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

After obtaining good consistency with the experimental results, the diffusion law of the warm drainage with the change of the environmental flow velocity was obtained by changing the ocean current velocity. Finally, a partial design was carried out at the bottom of the ship: a baffle was added between the water outlet and the water inlet. Two parameters of the baffle are determined: position and height.

Whereas sequential programming largely allowed the decoupling of source from underlying architecture, it is now impossible to develop new patterns and abstractions in isolation from issues of modern hardware utilization. Synchronization and coordination are now manifested at all levels of the software stack, and developers currently lack the essential tools to even partially automate reasoning techniques and system configuration management. As a first stage to addressing this problem, this paper proposes a framework for a tool suite designed to partially automate the acquisition and management of static system visualization in a feedback loop with dynamic execution properties. This model enables developers to find a best fit system configuration, potentially reconciling resource contention and utilization tensions that are critical to multi-core platforms. The application of a prototype of this suite, Deja View, demonstrates how tool support can aid reasoning about causally related sets of changes across system artifacts.","1938-4300","978-1-4244-2187-9","10.1109/ASE.2008.57","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4639350","","Benchmark testing;Hardware;Computer architecture;Software;Programming;Feedback loop;NASA","","","","18","IEEE","7 Oct 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For those facilities using alternative fuels and possibly raw materials, past practices will also require altering to address the non-hazardous secondary material (NHSM) and Commercial and Industrial Solid Waste Incineration (CISWI) rules. Meanwhile, there is continued work by the industry and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to decipher and clarify final implementation steps of each rule and, in particular, to address the question of “what is a waste,” which drives facility implementation strategies. The Portland cement industry has a long and proven track record in historically implementing the PC MACT rules and in using alternative fuels and raw materials (AFR) for a variety of environmentally and economically beneficial reasons. As the final compliance steps are put in place, there are continuing questions on how the new rules will be successfully implemented, while optimizing plant operations and continuing to grow the important AFR programs. Given that this suite of regulations will forever change the playing field on day-to-day operations, and the historic use of AFR in cement plants in the U.S., there will be critical compliance and financial risk implications on how to best manage final decisions. This paper reviews final approaches for cement plant operators to maximize opportunities and reduce unintentional risks posed by the new rules, by exploring the lessons learned on implementing PC MACT, CISWI, and NHSM rules based on the authors' work with the Portland Cement Association, individual facilities, and general industry/EPA discussions.","1939-9367","","10.1109/TIA.2015.2456061","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7155555","Air pollution;cement industry;environmental management-pollution control;fuels;Air pollution;cement industry;environmental management-pollution control;fuels","Fuels;Kilns;Testing;Standards;Monitoring;Planning;Instruments","","","","3","IEEE","13 Jul 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article discusses the ""doctrine of equivalents,"" which allows the patent holder to expand a patent beyond its literal terms to cover subject matter it doesn't expressly mention. At its heart are two premises: first, it is difficult to capture the full scope of technical innovation in words; and second, some people are wiseguys. No matter how carefully a patent claim is worded, no matter how well it appears to cover an invention, there will always be those who will search eagerly for the loophole, a way to circumvent language and avoid infringement. Patent law rewards innovation with exclusivity for a limited time period. But the reason patents are printed and published is to encourage still further innovation. The problem arises when someone slyly avoids a patent's language without contributing anything new-in effect, appropriating the benefits of an invention without enriching the art. Ultimately, the doctrine of equivalents plays a marginal role in patent law. That's because reasonably well-written patent claims are not, in the main, easy to avoid if the benefits of the invention are to be retained. Courts apply the doctrine to catch the occasional wiseguy while defending the certainty patent claims are supposed to provide. The Supreme Courts latest adjustment notwithstanding, that role is likely to continue.","1939-9340","","10.1109/MSPEC.2002.1015437","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1015437","","Patents;Legal factors","","","","","IEEE","7 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"

However the discussion is not settled because there is no theorem explaining its prevalence, in particular for naturally occurring scale-invariant data. Here we review Benford's distribution for continuous random variables under scale invariance. The implausibility of strict scale invariance leads us to a generalisation of Benford's distribution based on Pareto variables. This new model is more realistic, because real datasets are more prone to complying with a relaxed, rather than strict, definition of scale invariance. We also argue against forensic detection tests based on the distribution of the most significant digit. To show the arbitrariness of these tests, we give discrete distributions of the first coefficient of a continued fraction which hold in the exact same conditions as Benford's distribution and its generalisation.","2076-1465","978-9-0827-9706-0","10.23919/EUSIPCO54536.2021.9616057","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9616057","Benford's law;Pareto distribution;forensics;continued fractions","Forensics;Europe;Signal processing;Random variables","","1","","18","","8 Dec 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We claim that Benford's law describes the inter-arrival time of UDP packets and flows in normal traffic of networks. As a result, any significant anomaly in UDP packets and flows including deliberate intrusions, unwanted errors or in general, network failures, can be identified by checking the first digit distribution inter-arrival time of UDP packets and flows. In a recent work, the relationship between Weibull distribution and Benford's law was studied. In another work, the compliance of the inter-arrival time of UDP packets and flows from Weibull distribution is presented.

Every inventor, every company, every patent attorney and agent, every patent search firm and patent marketing agency was affected by GATT. Whole new policies and approaches to obtaining patent protection for inventions are now required to meet the challenges of the new patent laws. For example, individual inventors can get priority for their inventions for only $75.

The designed system will integrate real-time data collection from various IoT devices such as cameras, speed sensors, and RFID readers and incorporate complex machine learning algorithms to detect offences on the road and control the traffic patterns accordingly. In a three-month prototype application in a small metropolitan area, the system demonstrated a traffic violation detection rate of 92.3% - including speeding and red-light running - with a reduction of false positives compared to traditional methods of 28%. Upon putting the system to use, releases in traffic violations were cut by 30%, and the punctuality of the traffic flow during rush hour was given a 15% boost with evidence of the reduction of average waiting time at major junctions. Furthermore, it enhanced the response time via technology, with responders achieving an 18% cut in the average response time of emergency vehicles compared to the original method. Nevertheless, some problems were observed: first, high dependence on the Internet - the data processing of objectives was slowed down by 12% of regions with a weak Internet connection. In addition, 14 % of users reported concerns about data privacy, showing the necessity of taking steps to improve data protection. The results reveal that while the IoT -based vehicular control system yields benefits for enforcing traffic laws, key challenges relating to connectivity, the privacy of information, and system adaptability must be addressed if it is to be first applied and then effectively implemented in extensive urban environments.","","979-8-3503-7952-5","10.1109/INSPECT63485.2024.10896210","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10896210","Artificial Intelligence (AI);Internet of Things (IoT);Industry 4.0;Autonomous Vehicles (AVs);Smart Industrial Revolution;High-Speed Connectivity;Low-Latency Connectivity Vehicle Safety","Systematics;Law enforcement;Smart cities;Vehicle safety;Prototypes;Traffic control;Data collection;Real-time systems;Time factors;Internet of Things","","","","17","IEEE","27 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The strength of partial discharge and the formation of soil discharge channels are closely related to the magnitude of the critical breakdown field strength. Therefore, how to accurately obtain the variation law of the critical breakdown field strength of typical soil is the key to realize the safe operation of the grounding device and the cable in the ground and ensure the safety of personnel and equipment. In this paper, a simulation experiment of soil impact characteristics is used to study the variation law of typical soil critical breakdown field strength with soil properties. X-ray transmission imaging technology is used to obtain the morphology of the discharge channel, and its non-intrusive observation method will not disturb the discharge channel itself, making the measurement more accurate. This paper first selects a variety of typical soils to study the influence of soil moisture, salt content, compactness and other factors on the discharge channel morphology, and then studies the calculation method of the critical breakdown field strength of the soil under different discharge channel morphologies. And further explore the reasons for the influence of typical soil media factors on the critical breakdown field strength.

The intelligent judge system has made remarkable progress due to advancements in natural language processing, particularly deep learning. Matching similar cases has enormous potential with significant implications for the legal domain. Matching and analyzing similar cases helps legal professionals make more reasonable judgments, ensuring fairness, consistency, and accuracy in law applications. The existing methods did not fully use representation-based and interaction-based text matching in the feature extraction. This paper presents an innovative approach that employs ensemble learning with multiple models to enhance the prediction of legal case similarity. The method comprises two sub-networks: a similarity representation sub-network and a binary classification judgment sub-network. The similarity representation sub-network is trained using contrastive learning, focusing on semanticizing the similarity between sample features to distinguish between dissimilar samples and reduce the distance between similar ones. Furthermore, the binary classification judgment sub-network integrates sample pairs to facilitate feature interaction between text pairs during extraction. The training of these two sub-networks employs different information processing and optimization loss, which allows ensemble learning to capitalize on the strengths of both models and significantly improve the accuracy of predicting the similarity of legal cases. The accuracy of our method on the test set is 74.53%, outperforming other existing methods on the public dataset CAIL2019-SCM.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3371262","Social Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province of China(grant numbers:2018F028); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10452323","Similarity document matching;ensemble learning;contrastive learning;binary classification","Law;Feature extraction;Ensemble learning;Semantics;Artificial intelligence;Task analysis;Document handling;Image matching;Classification algorithms;Binary codes;Legal factors;Natural language processing","","","","44","CCBYNCND","27 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"A general model for the CO–H2 conversion factor in galaxies with applications to the star formation law","D. Narayanan; M. R. Krumholz; E. C. Ostriker; L. Hernquist",NA; NA; NA; NA,Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society,"19 Jan 2018","2012","421","4","3127","3146","The most common means of converting an observed CO line intensity into a molecular gas mass requires the use of a conversion factor (XCO). While in the Milky Way this quantity does not appear to vary significantly, there is good reason to believe that XCO will depend on the larger‐scale galactic environment. With sensitive instruments pushing detections to increasingly high redshift, characterizing XCO as a function of physical conditions is crucial to our understanding of galaxy evolution. Utilizing numerical models, we investigate how varying metallicities, gas temperatures and velocity dispersions in galaxies impacts the way CO line emission traces the underlying H2 gas mass, and under what circumstances XCO may differ from the Galactic mean value. We find that, due to the combined effects of increased gas temperature and velocity dispersion, XCO is depressed below the Galactic mean in high surface density environments such as ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). In contrast, in low‐metallicity environments, XCO tends to be higher than in the Milky Way, due to photodissociation of CO in metal‐poor clouds. At higher redshifts, gas‐rich discs may have gravitationally unstable clumps that are warm (due to increased star formation) and have elevated velocity dispersions. These discs tend to have XCO values ranging between present‐epoch gas‐rich mergers and quiescent discs at low z. This model shows that on average mergers do have lower XCO values than disc galaxies, though there is significant overlap. XCO varies smoothly with the local conditions within a galaxy, and is not a function of global galaxy morphology. We combine our results to provide a general fitting formula for XCO as a function of CO line intensity and metallicity. We show that replacing the traditional approach of using one constant XCO for starbursts and another for discs with our best‐fitting function produces star formation laws that are continuous rather than bimodal, and that have significantly reduced scatter.","1365-2966","","10.1111/j.1365-2966.2012.20536.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8174333","ISM: clouds;ISM: molecules;galaxies: interactions;galaxies: ISM;galaxies: starburst;galaxies: star formation","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Plasma particles penetrate the ablating gas-plasma cloud to the evaporating pellet surface and deliver power to the cloud to drive its expansion. The evaporation rate is determined by a ""self-regulating"" mechanism. The ablation time is shown to be proportional to a5/3λo-2/3Γo-1/3 where a is the pellet radius, λo is the effective penetration depth of the incident particle into solid hydrogen and Γo is the power flux density of the incident particles. It is found that for ablation in a thermonuclear plasma, the alpha particles significantly affect the ablation rate. For thermonuclear plasma electrons and alpha particles, the energy required to ablate one molecule is shown to be of the order of 10 eV or less.

The relevance of research. The authors of the article note that modern education in Russia and internationally is undergoing significant changes due to the active introduction of artificial intelligence into human life. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a way to make a computer—controlled robot or program capable of thinking as intelligently as a person. The basis for the creation of artificial intelligence are the following sciences and technologies: computer science, biology, psychology, linguistics.. The novelty of the research lies in determining the main directions of transformation of the educational process at the university in the conditions of cybersocialization of society. The purpose of the study is to identify the possibilities and problems of using artificial intelligence in the educational process and jurisprudence. The main tasks that need to be solved in this work: 1. To understand the reasons for the creation of artificial intelligence and the possibilities of its application in education and law at the present stage of development of society; 2. To explore possible areas of application of artificial intelligence technologies in the educational process; 3. To reveal the prospects of using artificial intelligence in teaching students and schoolchildren; 4. Evaluate the pros and cons of using artificial intelligence in education and law. The object of research in this article is artificial intelligence technologies.

Yu.Uvarova and A. Y.Akimova, on which this article is based, talk about the properties of digital education and the use of artificial intelligence technologies in it, about its possible advantages. Among them: accessibility, increasing the level of interactivity of training, the ability to choose the time, maximum audience coverage. The practical significance of the research lies in the possibility of applying its results in educational institutions of secondary education, secondary vocational education and higher education. Conclusions of the study: 1. Intellectual is a system that allows you to enhance a person’s mental activity by conducting a meaningful dialogue with him. 2. It is obvious that it is impossible and unnecessary to create a universal artificial intelligence. Highly specialized intellectual systems should be created, for example in education and law, which will not replace a person, but will facilitate his work. A person is not able to read a novel in one minute. The computer can do it. 3. The joint activity of man and machine, which analyzes information and presents it for selection, becomes relevant. 4. Today, artificial intelligence is a self-learning tool that enhances human activity in generating and making decisions. 5. In the current period, it will be necessary to resolve the issue of correlating the experience of introducing artificial intelligence into the most important social institutions of society, including education, and the existing proven practices of the traditional form of education.","","979-8-3503-2656-7","10.1109/TELE58910.2023.10184378","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10184378","artificial intelligence;digital education;law;technologies in law;informatization of education;educational process;education","Training;Learning systems;Resistance;Education;Standards organizations;Learning (artificial intelligence);Problem-solving","","1","","9","IEEE","21 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The study of the topology known as complex network theory has revealed the omnipresence of power law topology in many real networks. This power law topology is known to provide high efficiency in data exchange among individual nodes as well as robustness against random failures on them. For this reason, this topological structure has been adopted in several algorithms for the construction of an overlay network in the context of peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. All of them are based on a growing mechanism that requires continuous joining process of nodes. In this paper we propose a non-growing algorithm to construct a power law topology for overlay networks which have important implications for the evolution of the Internet to the next generation networks. The implementation of the algorithm is fully distributed that does not require a centrally dedicated server, thus, make them more secure against a single point failure of the system. Moreover, we demonstrate how the rewired topology takes advantage of its topological structure by analyzing its basic topological properties as well as robustness and efficiency.","2166-0077","978-1-4244-8865-0","10.1109/GLOCOMW.2010.5700333","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5700333","Self-Organizing;Future networks;Power law topology;non-growing mechanism","Topology;Peer to peer computing;Robustness;Organizing;Internet;Complex networks","","1","","14","IEEE","24 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, since it was ratified on Monday, October $5^{\mathrm{th}}$, 2020, the law has continued to cause debate and polemic from various elements of society. The reason is the lack of information media related to the Job Creation Law, especially interactive media for information dissemination. Moreover, the official document has 1187 pages which led the people hard to comprehend the document itself. One of the technologies that can be used as interactive media is a chatbot. A chatbot is a computer program that can simulate a conversation with a human. Chatbot itself is the development of Natural Language Processing. This study aims to build OLCBot, a chatbot that can act as an interactive medium for disseminating information on this law. Using the Fuzzy String Matching approach and Sastrawi stemmer, this chatbot is expected to understand and answer users’ questions related to the law. The chatbot knowledge base was taken from the manuscript of the Law of the Republic of Indonesia No. 11 of 2020 on Job Creation.

To solve these problems, the sliding mode control method based on improved reaching law is proposed. In improved reaching law, reasonable reaching terms are designed and the continuous function is used instead of symbolic function. The stability of improved reaching law is proved by Lyapunov stability theory. The simulation results show that, compared with the sliding mode control method based on traditional exponential reaching law, the improved method can not only effectively suppress chattering phenomenon, but also improve the convergence speed and robustness.

This paper proposes an adaptive LOS (ALOS) guidance law that can balance rapidity and overshoot while compensating for sideslip angle. The proposed algorithm uses adaptive parameter based on the cross-track error to real-time adjust the look-ahead distance and adaptively calculate a reasonable desired heading angle. An adaptive integral state is designed based on the adaptive parameter to compensate the impact of sideslip angle and then calculate the desired heading angle. Through stability analysis, it is proven that ALOS has uniform semiglobal exponential stability (USGES) at the balancing point. Finally, lake trials results shows that ALOS effectively suppressed overshoot and compensated for disturbance of waves, wind and ocean currents while reducing lateral cross-track error by 52.3% in similar converge speed with LOS.

In order to put forward the layout scheme of wireless temperature sensor in the on-line temperature monitoring system of dry-type air-core reactor, the finite element temperature simulation calculation is carried out according to the principle of multi-physical field coupling, and the radial and axial temperature distribution laws of the reactor are summarized and analyzed. In the radial direction, the encapsulation temperature of the middle layer was higher than that of the outer layer. In the axial direction, the temperature gradually increases from the bottom to the top, and the highest hot spot of each layer is located at the upper part of the axial height of the reactor. The accuracy of the finite element simulation calculation was confirmed by the outermost encapsulation temperature of the infrared detection, and the layout scheme of the wireless temperature sensor was proposed. The simulation is carried out when different encapsulations fail. When the reactor fails, the hottest spot of temperature changes from the top of the reactor to the fault location. The closer to the fault location, the higher the temperature rises. And the fault occurs at any position in the axial direction, at least one sensor can detect the temperature change. Combined with the distribution of hot spots in normal operation and fault, the layout position of temperature sensor is verified to improve the effectiveness and reliability of temperature detection.","","979-8-3503-3058-8","10.1109/CRC60659.2023.10488534","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10488534","dry-type air-core reactor;finite element analysis;wireless temperature measurement;sensor layout","Temperature sensors;Encapsulation;Temperature measurement;Wireless communication;Temperature distribution;Wireless sensor networks;Layout","","","","22","IEEE","9 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, the MDOF robots are over constrained systems, which are difficult to control. By this reason, MDOF robots are limited to simple applications, like following a guide-wire.

Traditional methods for detecting and characterizing irregularities have utilized specialized and expensive GNSS scintillation monitors specifically designed to measure rapid signal fluctuations. From a coverage perspective, the number and availability of these sensors is quite limited. For this reason, we explore alternative methods for global irregularity monitoring and characterization using existing sensors and infrastructure.

Although game concepts have been adopted in various problem domains, understanding the nature of game playing's underlying mechanism has been limited. This study investigates such a mechanism by adopting a logistic model of game outcome uncertainty where a measure of game refinement had been derived. Application of such a measure to the popular board and sports games have been conducted to determine its implication in determining sophisticated design and has defined the harmonic balance between skill and chance. A theoretical analysis using practical data confirms the effectiveness of the proposed model, where reasonable game length is determined based on the definition of a gamified experience.

Among the multitude of applications in this space, legal document classification emerges as a pivotal yet complex undertaking. Legal texts, characterized by unique domain-centric semantics and intricate linguistic patterns, necessitate precision-driven classification systems for numerous practical implications. This paper illuminates the challenges and opportunities in automating the classification of European Union (EU) legal documents, emphasizing the interrelationships among statutes and the hierarchical nature of legal references. In this context, we introduce a novel graph data modeling technique that adeptly marries content-centric indicators with the relational dynamics inherent among diverse legal documents. Central to our approach is a framework that melds text embeddings with graph neural networks for the classification of legal documents aligned with their subject-based directories. Empirical evaluations on the EU law dataset underline the efficacy of our model across varying granularities, from general thematic categories to intricate subtopics. This endeavor not only augments the comprehensibility and accessibility of EU jurisprudence but also holds significant implications across regulatory compliance, legal research, and policy formulation, underscoring the potential of deep learning in reshaping legal paradigms.","","979-8-3503-2445-7","10.1109/BigData59044.2023.10386684","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10386684","legal document classification;natural language processing;graph neural networks","Deep learning;Law;Semantics;Europe;Linguistics;Big Data;Graph neural networks","","1","","44","IEEE","22 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Identity management is a security feature that enables users to manage and utilize their digital identities when interacting with online services. A self-sovereign identity (SSI) system is a cutting-edge identity model that uses blockchain technology to foster peer-to-peer trust in service authentication and authorization. SSI systems typically adhere to a set of functional- and quality-related principles and properties. However, we discovered that the current information security and privacy principles and properties of SSI systems are not compliant with the laws, regulations, and technical standards. A compliance set of principles and properties must be established to support the implementation of SSI systems and to improve security and privacy. In this article, we propose CSSPS, a new compliance SSI system property set that expands upon the missing security and privacy controls specified in applicable laws, regulations, and technical standards. We used systematic comparative analysis and systematic review to identify inconsistent content from a vast collection of applicable sources, and then used them to extend the current properties of the SSI system. The proposed CSSPS increases the consistency of security and privacy controls, and is applicable in accordance with the functionality of real SSI systems, as determined by a qualitative evaluation. The proposed CSSPS contributes to SSI system implementation by facilitating correct implementation, while adhering to applicable information security and privacy sources. In addition, the proposed CSSPS can indirectly enhance the security and privacy of SSI systems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3204112","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9875265","Information security and privacy;legislative compliance;self-sovereign identity;standard compliance;system property","Identity management systems;Regulation;Information security;Blockchains;Security;Privacy","","5","","55","CCBY","5 Sep 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study is motivated to address this real-world problem by designing a system that streamlines telephone call audit processes. This can be verified with digital technologies to meet security requirements as well as legal requirements stipulated by the Australian National Electricity Rules. In meeting security and legal compliance requirements of the Australian National Electricity Rules, this study develops a novel approach using the Clark-Wilson Integrity Model and blockchain technology for an automatic telephone call audit system with security provisions to prevent unauthorized access to and manipulation of telephone call records nationally. Although the application of blockchain has generated great interest in other areas, few studies have been conducted on its application to auditing. This study uses the Clark-Wilson Integrity Model to verify metadata records’ integrity at the systems where metadata are generated.

Ideal diffuse reflection, aka Lambertian reflection, has equal reflected energy at all angles away from the plane. This leads to Lambert's cosine law that says the observed radiance from the area will be proportional to the cosine of the incidence angle. This result has been interpreted in differing ways which we will address here to show that the same reasoning leads to other 'laws' in other situations. The key is that Lambert's law refers to a defined illuminated area of a plane and the energy coming off that area, for an ideal diffuse reflector when irradiated at a particular angle of incidence. It is the result of the geometry that the range of incident angles of light reaching the observer will follow exactly the cosine law. In the case sidescan sonar the area being ensonified also changes with the angle as does the area contributing to the reflected energy in a particular time bin. This changes the cosine law to a cotangent law. The sine in the denominator is due to the changing size of the area being observed at different angles.","2377-6536","978-1-7281-8757-0","10.1109/AUV50043.2020.9267946","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9267946","","Sonar;Sea surface;Backscatter;Sonar measurements;Solids;Transducers;Geometry","","7","","15","IEEE","30 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, the mathematical model of PMSM under demagnetization fault state is established, and the reasons for poor fault tolerance of the conventional PI controller are analyzed. A new convergence law is used to design the speed loop sliding mode feedback controller, and its stability is demonstrated. Meanwhile, an adaptive forgetting factor recursive least squares (AFRLS) flux linkage observer is designed to keep the controller parameter values in line with the actual motor parameter values, to reduce the impact of demagnetization faults on motor control performance and achieve fault-tolerant control of demagnetization faults. Finally, simulation and experimental comparison with conventional PI control demonstrate that the proposed method is more robust and resistant to interference.","2836-4619","","10.23919/CJEE.2024.000082","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52077011); Hunan Provincial Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:2024JJ7614,2024JJ7615,2024JJ6089); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10596094","Permanent magnet synchronous motor;demagnetization faults;sliding mode fault-tolerant control;flux linkage observer","Demagnetization;Mathematical models;Fault tolerant systems;Fault tolerance;Couplings;Torque;Permanent magnets","","1","","26","","11 Jul 2024","","","CMP","CMP Journals"

As an introduction, a review of the PO theory for Gaussian-correlated surfaces is provided, and in this process an analytical summation of the PO series for specular scattering from Gaussian-correlated surfaces is obtained. A similar form is then derived for specular scattering from exponentially correlated surfaces and contrasted to the Gaussian case. These series allow the accuracy of the leading order term (i.e., the geometrical optics limit) in the high-frequency approximation of PO scattering for Gaussian or exponentially correlated surfaces to be investigated analytically. The leading order term in the high-frequency expansion for general PO scattering from exponentially correlated surfaces (Hagfors' Law) is then reviewed and interpreted in terms of a recently published theory of PO for surfaces with infinite rms slopes. The approximate ldquocutoffrdquo wavenumber from Hagfors' Law at which the high-frequency portion of the spectrum of an exponentially correlated surface can be truncated without producing large errors in PO predicted scattering is also discussed. Using this cutoff wavenumber, an approximate region of validity of the complete PO theory for exponentially correlated surfaces is obtained. The validity condition indicates that, for fixed surface statistics, the PO method produces accurate predictions of true surface scattering only up to a specific frequency, and that PO is inaccurate in the high-frequency limit. Comparisons of PO predictions with those of a Monte Carlo numerical simulation are used to show that the validity condition derived appears to provide a reasonable indication of PO accuracy. These results have important implications for current investigations of scattering from exponentially correlated surfaces and for the use of Hagfors' Law, as it is traditional to accept PO as the appropriate high-frequency limit in most existing approximate models of surface scattering.","1558-0644","","10.1109/TGRS.2007.900682","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4276889","Rough surface scattering","Geometrical optics;Physical optics;Optical scattering;Optical surface waves;Rough surfaces;Surface roughness;Gaussian processes;Surface waves;Statistics;Frequency","","31","","17","IEEE","23 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In order to study the melting erosion law on the contact interface of a multiturn series-parallel (MSP) railgun, an EM structure thermal multiphysical field coupling model is built, and the armature velocity, contact force, and temperature of contact interface under different current peak values and shrink ranges are analyzed. Besides, the related verification experiments are carried out, and the melting erosion law of the contact interface is obtained. The results of simulations and experiments show the following conclusions: First, during the launching, the contact force between armature and rails varies with current fluctuation. Second, the friction heat power varies directly with the contact force, but Joule thermal power caused by contact resistance varies inversely with the contact force. Third, the ambient temperature of the sliding contact interface can be further improved by reasonable design of armature shrink range. Fourth, due to the inevitable wear during sliding, the melting area of the armature contact surface gradually transfers from the initial contact area to the tail.

[Question/ problem]: However, interpreting regulations still largely depends on individual legal expertise and experience within the respective domain, with little to no systematic methodologies and supportive tools to guide this practice. In fact, research in this area is too often detached from practitioners' experiences, rendering the proposed solutions not transferable to industrial practice. As we argue, one reason is that we still lack a profound understanding of industry- and domain-specific practices and challenges. [Principal ideas/ results]: We aim to close this gap and provide such an investigation at the example of the banking and insurance domain. We conduct an industrial multi-case study as part of a long-term academia-industry collaboration with a mediumsized software development and renovation company. We explore contemporary industrial practices and challenges when inferring requirements from regulations to support more problem-driven research.

The global, decentralized nature of cloud computing presents numerous issues that we are just now grappling with in our endeavors to protect privacy rights, meet compliance demands, and maintain a secure computing environment. This chapter covers effective risk management, risk metrics, and strategies for an effective risk management program. Policies are one of the foundational elements of a governance and risk management program. They guide the organization, based on standards and guidelines. Policies ensure that the organization is operating within its risk profile. Policies actually define, or are the expression of, the organization's risk tolerance. Cloud computing as it exists today has commoditized compute, storage and networking services. Enterprise risk management has shifted in response to this change. It is vitally important that both the customer and the provider focus on risk management and the challenges presented with cloud computing.

"MSHA's electrical regulations: Use prudence to avoid pitfalls","C. G. Ruffennach","Attorney, Washington DC",2014 IEEE-IAS/PCA Cement Industry Technical Conference,"26 May 2014","2014","","","1","11","The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is a federal law enforcement agency that enforces electrical and other regulations at mining and cement operations. Many of the electrical regulations, which are set out at 30 C.F.R. Part 56.12, can be fairly characterized as simplistic, broad, dated and confusing. MSHA often reads requirements or prohibitions into its regulations that are not evident from the language of the regulations. Mine operators need to understand that the regulations are essentially interpreted by MSHA using a “reasonably prudent person” standard. An operator's failure to anticipate MSHA's changing expectations for a reasonably prudent person can result in substantial penalties, closure orders, abatement predicaments and even penalties against its management. Supervisors and managers with responsibility for electrical systems, particularly those using newer technologies that are beyond MSHA's expertise, need to be proactive in anticipating, avoiding and addressing creative MSHA enforcement.","2155-9155","978-1-4799-3294-8","10.1109/CITCon.2014.6820116","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6820116","","Standards;Inspection;Gravity;Auditory system;Government;Hazards","","","","9","IEEE","26 May 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The inefficiency of rate limits is due to its encouragement of fuel use (""Btu dilution"") and to a reduction of cost-effective energy transactions. Emissions dispatch is confirmed as an economical technique for NO/sub x/ compliance. However, the cost-effective range of emissions dispatch is significantly reduced under lb/MBtu regulation, especially when the power system has large opportunities for trading energy.","1558-0679","","10.1109/59.544632","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=544632","","Production;Costing;Costs;Fuels;Investments;Power engineering and energy;Boilers;Monitoring;USA Councils;Power system economics","","16","","26","IEEE","6 Aug 2002","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The open government datasets to be mashed-up by developers may be subject to distinct licenses, legal notices, terms of use, and applicable law and regulations from multiple jurisdictions. Within this complex ecosystem there is a need to create semi-automatic tools supported by an ontology to help technical reusers of Public Sector Information to utilize datasets according to their intended purpose and in compliance with the legal obligations that govern the rights to reuse the data. Unfortunately, some researchers may avoid considering all the legal frameworks that apply in the domain of Open Government Data and limit their investigation to only the area of licenses. To enable wider, compliant utilisation of mashed-up open data, we have analysed the European Union (EU) legal framework of reuse of Public Sector Information (PSI), the EU Database Directive and copyright framework and other legal sources (e.g., licenses, legal notices, terms of use) that can apply to open government Datasets. From this deep analysis we now model several major concepts in an Ontology of Open Government Data Licenses Framework for a Mash-up Model (OGDL4M). There have been earlier ontologies for creative commons or open licenses, but they did not anticipate the other legal constraints that arise from Open Government regulations. The OGDL4M ontology will be used for qualifying datasets in order to improve the accuracy of their legal annotation. The Ontology also aims to connect each applicable legal rule to official legal texts in order to direct legal experts and reusers to primary sources. This paper aims to present the modules of the OGDL4M ontology in depth and to describe some preliminary evaluation.","","978-1-5090-6719-0","10.1109/CeDEM.2017.25","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8046278","open government data mash-up;licensing of open government data;legal ontology","Law;Ontologies;Licenses;Databases;Government;Terminology","","10","","34","IEEE","21 Sep 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The idea is a modification of the well-studied preferential attachment scheme in which the degree of each node is used to determine its evolving connectivity. Modifications to this base protocol to include features other than connectivity have been considered in building the network. However, schemes based on preferential attachment in any form require substantial information on the entire network. We propose instead a protocol based only on a single statistical feature which results from the reasonable assumption that the effect of various attributes, which determine the ability of each node to attract other nodes, is multiplicative. This composite attribute or fitness is lognormally distributed and is used in forming the complex network. We show that, by varying the parameters of the lognormal distribution, we can recover both exponential and power-law degree distributions. The exponents for the power-law case are in the correct range seen in real- world networks such as the World Wide Web and the Internet. Further, as power-law networks with exponents in the same range are a crucial ingredient of efficient search algorithms in peer-to- peer networks, we believe our network construct may serve as a basis for new protocols that will enable peer-to-peer networks to efficiently establish a topology conducive to optimized search procedures.","1095-2055","978-1-4244-4581-3","10.1109/ICCCN.2009.5235257","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5235257","","Protocols;Power generation;Peer to peer computing;Complex networks;IP networks;Computer science;Mathematics;Physics;Web sites;Network topology","","2","","25","IEEE","11 Sep 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The research focuses on improving the time-to-go estimation method, abandoning the small-angle assumption to achieve a more accurate estimation, and innovatively incorporating the field-of-view (FOV) constraint into the design of the guidance law. The guidance law ensures the missile’s seeker remains within the specified FOV even with large initial lead angles, improving stability and enhancing launch flexibility in complex environments. By selecting reasonable control parameters, the impact time error and lead angle of the missile converge rapidly, boosting guidance efficiency. Lyapunov stability theory verifies its reliability and safety, and the absence of singularities in the guidance command significantly enhances the system’s stability and robustness. The simulation results show that the proposed guidance law is adaptable to varieties of working conditions and exhibits excellent performance. Compared with the existing method, the guidance law satisfies the impact time control and FOV constraint even when the missile is launched at a large initial lead angle. This feature makes the guidance law show significant potential in the field of salvo attack.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3531042","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62203191); National Defense Science and Technology Key Laboratory Foundation of China(grant numbers:2022JCJQLB06105); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10844081","Impact time control;sliding mode guidance law;time-to-go estimation;field-of-view constraint;large lead angle;salvo attack","Missiles;Estimation;Line-of-sight propagation;Accuracy;Trajectory;Sliding mode control;Lead;Target tracking;Three-dimensional displays;Switches","","","","29","CCBY","17 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"AI for Sport in the EU Legal Framework","A. Orlando","Department of Legal Sciences, University of Salento, Lecce, Italy","2022 IEEE International Workshop on Sport, Technology and Research (STAR)","24 Aug 2022","2022","","","100","105","Artificial intelligence systems are used for a variety of reasons in sport. However, little has been explored about the legal challenges that can be directly linked to the use of AI systems in sports. This phenomenon must be framed within a legal framework in great turmoil, which has led national and supranational institutions to review privacy legislation in recent years and to attempt the first regulatory approaches in the field of AI. In particular, the EU is intervening heavily in these areas: the approval of the GDPR, which came into force in 2018, completely reformed the regulations on the protection of personal data; much more recently, in 2021, the European Commission published a proposal for a Regulation on AI (hereinafter, AI Act). Legal reflection on these issues is still in progress, but it is in an even more embryonic phase if we think about the impact of AI on the sporting phenomenon. In this context, we need to ask ourselves whether the current regulatory framework will hold up against the increasingly widespread and disparate uses of AI systems in the field of sport. In particular, compliance with the principles established by the GDPR must be assessed during all phases of the AI system's lifecycle. In this regard, there are problems relating to the accuracy of the data, the prevention and rectification of potential bias, the consent of the interested party, the principle of data minimization with respect to the purpose of the data processing, profiling and automated decision-making (Article 22). On the other hand, the uses of AI in the field of sport must be correctly framed in the regulatory framework proposed by the AI Act, with which the Commission has opted for a risk-based classification of AI systems (high, low and minimum), providing for different regimes of obligations and rights for the AI actors. The research aims to improve the advancement of knowledge for institutions, companies, associations, athletes and operators in the world of sport. In the European context, they are increasingly confronted with the use of AI systems which, on the one hand, have undoubted advantages for the improvement of sports performance, but on the other hand risk jeopardizing potential breaches of the fundamental rights of the people involved. The conclusions of the paper will try to trace the correct balance, from a juridical point of view, between the different needs and rights at stake, highlighting the strengths and criticalities of the current European regulatory framework, already in force or still in progress.","","978-1-6654-8601-9","10.1109/STAR53492.2022.9860029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9860029","artificial intelligence;AI for sport;AI Act;GDPR;sports law","Law;Force;Europe;Stars;Minimization;Regulation;Reflection","","3","","13","IEEE","24 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Although these technologies may provide great benefits, they can equally threaten the privacy of building occupants and raise data security concerns.Aim. The complexity of smart buildings poses difficulties when applying the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) in addressing the aforementioned concerns. This paper unpacks the specific ambiguities that make applying the GDPR in this context challenging and identify the key requirements for data controllers in managing data privacy. Methods. This paper takes on a doctrinal approach to research by drawing upon legal sources and existing scholarship in related fields, in particular, legal privacy scholars. Results. The pressing compliance problems stem from the debate on what is considered as 'personal data' in smart buildings in which dictates the compliance requirements, in particular, data protection impact assessments (DPIAs). We identify three facets that smart building controllers should focus on in complying with the GDPR: establishing personal data, identifying individual rights, and determining a high risk to the rights and freedom of natural persons. Conclusions. The law can help prevent harms and ensure that individual rights are protected in smart buildings. To achieve this, understanding the compliance pain points of smart environment in order to strike the balance between the privacy of the occupants and the benefits of smart buildings is crucial. This is a call for further empirical and interdisciplinary research to effectively address the issues surrounding smart environment compliance challenges.","2768-0657","979-8-3503-2720-5","10.1109/EuroSPW59978.2023.00073","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10190708","Smart buildings;privacy;Security;Data Protection;Compliance;Law","Privacy;Smart buildings;Force measurement;Law;Data security;Organizations;Position measurement","","1","","41","IEEE","31 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Besides this, IEC 1000-3-2 regulations impose low input current harmonic contents for power levels higher than 75 W. In this paper, a recently proposed synchronous rectification scheme is combined with a modified input current shaper to design a 100 W, 3.3 V AC/DC converter that complies with IEC 1000-3-2 regulations. The efficiency obtained in the prototype was very high for this application (86%) and both the size increase and the cost increase were quite low in comparison with the original topology with no synchronous rectification and no IEC 1000-3-2 compliance.","1941-0107","","10.1109/TPEL.2003.813761","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1214519","","Low voltage;DC-DC power converters;IEC standards;Circuit topology;MOSFETs;Costs;Power factor correction;Power supplies;Windings;Rectifiers","","8","","17","IEEE","22 Jul 2003","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This problem has been discussed in this study under three viewpoints: i) the marine engine efficiency, ii) the decision-making process for selecting the technologies for reducing air emissions from shipping and iii) the challenges in the shipping industry during the era of digitalization. In the section of the marine engine efficiency, the fundamental laws of thermodynamics in relation to a Carnot cycle/heat engine have been illustrated to show the maximum efficiency that an engine can achieve within its operational temperature range. In the section of the decision-making process, the selection of technologies for reducing emissions from shipping, a variety of possible options has been discussed: e.g. using compliant fuels with low sulphur content in the current machinery; integrating an emission abatement technology such as marine scrubber as an after-treatment device; opting for alternative fuels such as Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) or Methanol and future ship propulsion with an array of alternatives. Nevertheless, it can be a challenge for decision-makers (shipowners and operators) to select the most suitable alternatives for regulatory compliance in reducing emissions from shipping. It involves with multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) in which a number of alternative options are assessed with regard to multiple factors and sub-factors as described in this study.

Using existing standards and guidelines that relate to assistive technology and care in the UK, we consider what aspects designers and developers of physically assistive robots would need to be aware of from a safety related perspective. Furthermore, in reviewing current assistive robotics standards and hazard analyses approaches we have found that these do not take into consideration safety aspects relating to a vulnerable user with accessibility needs (physical and cognitive), as well as fail to address issues relating to situations where the user is in physical contact with an assistive robot and is using it for physical support while it is moving. This paper highlights that more attention needs to be given to the changing physical and cognitive abilities of the end-user when considering safety and risks, and hopefully will encourage assistive robot designers to review health and care regulations in their own application context to inform safe design and ensure deployment doesn't get hindered due to lack of compliance to these types of standards and regulations.","","978-1-6654-3862-9","10.1109/ISR50024.2021.9419508","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9419508","","System verification;Psychology;Medical services;Rehabilitation robotics;Regulation;Hazards;Safety","","5","","22","IEEE","10 May 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The automotive industry is already in the race to adopt safe and secure OTASU, as by 2024, compliance to new UN regulations will become compulsory. However, the standards providing the specifications and requirements for OTASU are still in their infancy. Many other dependable system domains, that are now more digital and connected than ever, are following same trends towards OTASU. For instance, OTASU are very likely to be adopted in the railway domain in a near future, as the ability of remotely updating railway equipment considerably reduces maintenance costs and time, improving system availability. This paper describes how the UP2DATE framework adheres to existing and emerging regulations and standards and evaluates them through a railway case-study.

The 1998 Track Safety Standards and 1999 Passenger Equipment Safety Standards provide comprehensive requirements for the qualification and operation of passenger equipment. Among many safety issues, these standards address the response of rolling stock at speed to track deviations, and the potential for derailment and/or injury to passengers. The principles contained in the Safety Standards are also used by FRA to evaluate safety performance of vehicles for operation at high cant deficiency for speeds less than 90 mph as part of FRA's waiver process. This paper describes the types of static and dynamic tests and equipment that are required with respect to vehicle-track interaction to demonstrate compliance of new equipment with the Standards, and the technical fundamentals behind the requirements. Examples include the National Railroad Passenger Corporation's (Amtrak's) experiences in applying for waivers and qualifying new equipment under these regulations, particularly the high cant deficiency testing of the Talgo train in the Pacific Northwest, and the high-speed and high cant deficiency testing of Maryland Rail Commuter's (MARC's) MARC-III bi-level cars, Acela Express trainsets and Amtrak's high-horsepower electric locomotives in the Northeast Corridor. In addition, technical data and procedures necessary to have existing equipment approved for operation at higher speed or cant deficiency are also described.

Notwithstanding the popularity of AI approaches, actual adoption and implementation in fielded systems has been minimal. One of the reasons for this is the lag in an ancillary area, which is the development of corresponding standards and regulations to guide the practice. This paper aims to synthesize various studies in the literature regarding standards and regulations in data-driven PHM and then sets out the necessary requirements for a standards and regulations regime to support the full adoption of AI-enabled PHM. An acceptability criterion is proposed, which incorporates the various factors that must be considered for verification, validation, and certification of AI-enabled PHM technologies.

As a response, this paper presents guidelines to support the education sector in this regard. What underpins this work is the knowledge gained from a comprehensive examination of the current state of cybersecurity practices in Jordanian schools. Then, combining case studies, insight from expert consultations, and a review of Jordanian cybercrime legislation informed the guidelines on how schools should approach effective cybersecurity policy and implementation. The findings combine essential elements which span strategy, standards, hardware and software, and training. A core theme of these guidelines is how legal compliance can be achieved for school policies in relation to Jordanian Cybercrime Law and the negative effects of non-compliance. These outcomes have ramifications for school administrators and policymakers to acknowledge the urgent need to integrate legal and educational strategies to strengthen their cybersecurity practices. The intent of this recommended framework is for Jordanian schools to strike a balance complying with national cybercrime laws and fostering a secure educational environment. This proactive approach has a dual purpose. Institutions can be protected from cyber threats and in doing so promoting a culture of cybersecurity awareness among students and staff. However, this framework relies on administrators and policymakers to navigate the complexities of digital security in educational environments.","2831-4948","979-8-3315-4001-2","10.1109/ACIT62805.2024.10876919","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10876919","component;formatting;style;styling;insert","Training;Law;Reviews;Legislation;Software;Computer crime;Standards;Best practices;Guidelines;Resilience","","","","20","IEEE","17 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we examine how software engineers make these determinations using a multi-case study with three cases. Each case involves assessment of requirements for an electronic health record system that must comply with the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and is measured against the evaluations of HIPAA compliance subject matter experts. Our first case examines how individual graduate-level software engineering students assess whether the requirements met or exceeded their HIPAA obligations. Our second case replicates the findings from our first case using a different set of participants. Our third case examines how graduate-level software engineering students assess requirements using the Wideband Delphi approach to deriving consensus in groups. Our findings suggest that the average graduate-level software engineering student is ill-prepared to write legally compliant software with any confidence and that domain experts are an absolute necessity.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2014.2383374","NSF ITR(grant numbers:522931); NSF(grant numbers:0430166); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6991569","Legal Implementation Readiness;Regulatory Compliance Software Engineering;Legal Requirements;Requirements Engineering;Legal implementation readiness;regulatory compliance software engineering;legal requirements;requirements engineering","Law;Software;Software engineering;Atmospheric measurements;Particle measurements;Decision making","","10","","41","IEEE","18 Dec 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The Identity and Access Management (IAM) service is designed to allow you to specify what operations specific users can perform on particular resources. This is also described as specifying “who gets to do what on which resources.” IAM is the recommended way to control access in most cases. In some limited cases, such as in a development environment, the older primitive roles system may be used. An identity is an entity that represents a person or other agent that performs actions on a GCP resource. Identities are sometimes called members. Google accounts are used by people and represent people who interact with GCP, such as developers and administrators. These accounts are designated by an email address that is linked to a Google account. For example, jane.doe@gmail.com could be an identity in GCP. The domain of the email does not have to be gmail.com; it just has to be associated with a Google account. Service accounts are used by applications running in GCP. These are used to give applications their own set of access controls instead of relying on using a person's account for permissions.

With the growing consciousness of the consumers, it has become imperative for the business houses to act sustainably. Therefore, to put that responsibility into practice, the concept of issuance of green finance emerged, certain sources of green finance are green bonds, and green corporate social responsibility is dedicated to financing green projects that intend to upgrade the environment. However, with green finance, the challenging problem of greenwashing pops up, which deceives customers and other stakeholders into believing that the operations of corporate houses are environmentally sustainable. The researchers have emphasized the role of legal provisions that are attempting to leave no stone unturned to engage corporate houses in environment preservation nevertheless, there are certain lacunae associated with those legislations. Such norms are thriving to pay attention to the environmental degradation caused due to business houses and further compelling them to address these challenges in various forms ranging from issuance of green debt securities, calling out greenwashing to mandatory corporate social responsibility. The impact of green debt securities in advancing sustainability is descriptively discussed thereby addressing the various challenges associated with it that call for legal acknowledgment such as the lack of internal capacity and regime to manage the green bond process, the complex rules that require compliance, and the deceiving practices of companies such as greenwashing. Certain regulations dealing with green financing and responsible investment are critically examined concerning environmentally advanced countries in this study.</p>","","9781394234011","10.1002/9781394234035.ch6","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10955548.pdf&bkn=10955395&pdfType=chapter","","Green products;Air pollution;Finance;Security;Law;Investment;Climate change;Business;Companies;Sustainable development","","","","","","8 Apr 2025","","","Wiley","Wiley AI eBook Chapters"

However, after a decade of research, no universal personal navigation system has been successfully introduced and adopted to improve personal mobility. An analysis of the underlying reasons is conducted, looking at the engineering, human, ethical, and legal challenges. First, contrary to adopting classical mechanization equations linked to solid state physics, location technologies must address complex personal dynamics using connected objects. Second, human factors are often not sufficiently considered while designing new technologies. The needs and abilities of travelers are not systematically addressed from a user-centered perspective. Finally, people want to benefit from location-based services without sharing personal location data to uncontrolled third bodies. Europe is a pioneer in the protection of individuals from personal identification through data processing since location data has been recognized as personal data, but the challenges to enforce the regulation are numerous. The recommendation of “privacy by design and default” is an interesting key to conceive the universal personal navigation solution.

There is a considerable `legal lacuna' that exists creating much uncertainty within the industry with respect to investment and the direction of innovation. Drones are being utilised today under controlled conditions as technology and ability develops, but with this accelerated pace of technological development, existing regulations soon become limited to address new capabilities and thus become out of date. Policy has become law in many jurisdictions, but policy needs to be developed further to keep pace with demand because safety is paramount. This paper investigates and highlights legal aspects that a regulator and UTM stakeholders have to consider in developing good drone law. It is essential that a properly considered legal framework is developed for many reasons including, but not limited to, increased positive public perception, proliferation of innovation of use cases for Unmanned Aerial Systems, improved environmental impact and improved safety.

In addition to these reasons, India also has one of the world's lowest ratios of judges to population. For swift and efficient disposal of justice, it is important to fast-track this process as much as possible. A traditional solution to this problem would take a considerable amount of time to show any meaningful results considering the current backlog of cases and the rate at which new cases are being filed each day. In order to overcome these difficulties, we employ text embeddings from LLM's with statistical classifiers to effectively and precisely forecast the outcomes for writ petitions.

The observations were performed in six spectral bands that span the spectral range from the near-ultraviolet atmospheric cut-off to the near-infrared. We derive the extinction law by the extragalactic dust in the dark lanes in the spectral range 1.11 < λ−1 < 2.94 μm−1 by fitting model galaxies to the unextinguished parts of the image, and subtracting from these the actual images. This procedure allows the derivation, with reasonably high signal-to-noise ratio, of the extinction in each spectral band we used for each resolution element of the image. We also introduce an alternative method to derive the extinction values by comparing various colour-index maps under the assumption of negligible intrinsic colour gradients in these galaxies. We than compare the results obtained using these two methods. We compare the total-to-selective extinction derived for these galaxies with previously obtained results and with similar extinction values of Milky Way dust to derive conclusions about the properties of extragalactic dust in different objects and conditions. We find that the extinction curves run parallel to the Galactic extinction curve, which implies that the properties of dust in the extragalactic environment are similar to those of the Milky Way, despite our original expectations. The ratio of the total V-band extinction to the selective extinction between the V and B bands is derived for each galaxy with an average of 2.82 ± 0.38, compared to a canonical value of 3.1 for the Milky Way. The similar values imply that galaxies with well-defined dark lanes have characteristic dust grain sizes similar to those of Galactic dust. We use total optical extinction values to estimate the dust mass for each galaxy, compare these with dust masses derived from IRAS measurements, and find them in the range 104–107M⊙.","1365-2966","","10.1111/j.1365-2966.2008.13785.x","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8220117","dust, extinction;galaxies: elliptical and lenticular, cD","","","","","","","19 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Human Rights Watch (HRW) is a prominent campaigner against Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS) and has expressed concern these systems are fundamentally at odds with the international humanitarian law (IHL) framework for armed conflict. This framework places human control over the use of lethal force at the very heart of the targeting process. HRW asserts that the ceding of human control to AI-enabled capabilities may undermine and gradually erode the IHL framework, leaving the battlespace legally ungoverned and civilians unprotected. Concerns about the military use of AI have been exacerbated by the actions and narratives of some nations that are perceived as competing in an Al arms race. However, the debate about AI has been clouded by the fact that it focuses excessively on LAWS and human control. As a result, very little consideration is given to other potentially positive uses of AI technology in targeting. These include AI's role in Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance and Information Operations. This paper seeks to present a more nuanced examination of the role of AI in kinetic targeting and how it may affect compliance with IHL. The legal, ethical and technical arguments against and in favour of the use of AI will be examined. Finally, a way forward on this complex and emotive issue is proposed that offers a means to reinforce IHL whilst accepting that advances in technology will continue.","2325-5374","978-9916-9565-5-7","10.23919/CyCon51939.2021.9468301","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9468301","international humanitarian law;artificial intelligence;armed conflict;targeting","Heart;Law;Weapons;Surveillance;Force;Process control;Reconnaissance","","2","","0","","5 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Performance and resource consumption must be considered while creating such systems. Amdahl's law argues that the proportion of the workload that cannot be parallelized limits a system's speedup. This law affects system design in decentralized cluster data warehousing. In creating a decentralized cluster data warehouse, Amdahl's law requires detecting and evaluating bottlenecks in data input, storage, processing, and query execution. Designers may improve parallelizable components by understanding non-parallelizable components. A decentralized cluster data warehouse needs data propagation. Keeping frequently accessible data close may impair system performance. This requires exact data partition, replication, and cluster node data placement. Decentralized cluster data warehouses need technical, organizational, and governance concerns. Data security, privacy, regulatory compliance, and accessibility are examples. John Gustafson and Edwin Barsis' Gustafson's Law stresses parallel computing's scalability and workload rise. Gustafson's Law allows scaling up the issue and using more computer resources to handle higher workloads, unlike Amdahl's Law. The law shows that as the issue size increases, the percentage of the program that may be processed in parallel becomes a bigger fraction of the entire execution time, improving efficiency and speedup. Gustafson's Law promotes reducing execution time by dividing task over numerous processors. This abstract compares Gustafson's Law with Amdahl's Law, revealing parallel computing's advantages for bigger problem instances and the impact of increasing workload in parallel efficiency.","2768-0673","979-8-3503-4148-5","10.1109/I-SMAC58438.2023.10290405","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10290405","Decentralized cluster data warehouses;Amdahl's law;Data;dissemination;Gustafson's Law","Costs;Scalability;Warehousing;Systems architecture;Organizations;Computer architecture;Data warehouses","","1","","19","IEEE","26 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Thus, we propose a network-wide traffic volume estimation method using data from connected vehicles with the observed traffic volume data. This method employs joint matrix factorization, which facilitates the integrated analysis of diverse data sources. Furthermore, we incorporated traffic flow conservation law to ensure the conservation of inflow and outflow at each intersection as a regularization term.

The proposed control laws are based on the distance-based formation control; therefore, each distance between agents is controlled measuring the relative position. Because the control laws use only local information such as relative position with respect to their own local reference frame, the control laws are completely decentralized. The proposed control laws are designed to make a group of agents keep the desired formation and move with a constant reference velocity in two-dimensional space. The considered system consists of three types of agents: 1) leader; 2) first follower; and 3) follower. The leader knows the reference velocity value, whereas the other agents do not know the reference velocity. For this reason, the first follower and follower estimate the reference velocity by using the adaptive method. Using graph theory and nonlinear control theory, the control laws are verified mathematically. Additionally, the three-agent case is extended to $N$-agent case by an inductive way. The stability and convergence of the system are theoretically analyzed, and the validity of the proposed control laws is clarified by performing simulations and real experiments.","1557-9948","","10.1109/TIE.2015.2504041","Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism (MCST); Korea Creative Content Agency (KOCCA); Culture Technology (CT) Research & Development Program 2014; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7337446","Formation control;Adaptive method;Distributed control;Adaptive method;distributed control;formation control;nonlinear control","Position measurement;Multi-agent systems;Convergence;Aerospace electronics;Animals;Shape;Stability analysis","","77","","28","IEEE","25 Nov 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

These variations in ENF cause the luminance intensity of a mains-powered light source, having no AC/DC converter inside, also to fluctuate. As a result, a video of a scene illuminated by a mains-powered light source can be used to estimate these fluctuations. As a consequence, the ENF signal within the time period when the video was captured can be estimated. This work explores the effects of frame rate harmonics that emerge when a rolling shutter based approach is used for ENF estimation from videos captured using CMOS cameras. These harmonics are a problem, especially for videos whose frame rate is a divisor of the nominal ENF because the frame rate harmonics and the ENF harmonics overlap. It is discovered that a key reason for the presence of the harmonics is the inverse square law of light that results in some repeating patterns of luminance variation across frames. This paper presents an analysis of the effect of the inverse square law of light on ENF estimation. A technique for refined ENF-related luminance signal estimation is proposed that attenuates these frame rate harmonics. This enables more accurate ENF estimates. The work also proposes an approach to estimate ENF-related luminance waveform cycles within each video frame, and a method to compute the confidence score for the estimated cycles. It provides insight into the reliability of the extracted ENF signal from a video, in the sense of its usefulness for ENF forensics, and consequently for ENF detection, which is an important precursor to ENF-based video forensics.","1556-6021","","10.1109/TIFS.2022.3220029","Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency; Air Force Research Laboratory(grant numbers:FA8750-16-2-0173); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9940312","ENF;electric network frequency;video forensics;multimedia forensics;camera forensics;rolling shutter;idle period;frame rate harmonics;time-of-recording;time-stamp verification","Videos;Harmonic analysis;Estimation;Light sources;Cameras;Forensics;Frequency estimation","","8","","41","IEEE","4 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Cyberbullying and cyber law","B. E. Cartwright","School of Criminology Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, B.C., Canada",2016 IEEE International Conference on Cybercrime and Computer Forensic (ICCCF),"17 Nov 2016","2016","","","1","7","This paper examines two recent Canadian legislative initiatives intended in whole or in part to combat cyberbullying: the Cyber-Safety Act of Nova Scotia and the Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act. Both pieces of legislation were responses to the suicide deaths of female teenagers Rehtaeh Parsons in Nova Scotia and Amanda Todd in British Columbia. It is questionable whether either suicide was directly caused by cyberbullying. Todd was primarily a victim of an adult “capper” living in the Netherlands, who persuaded her to expose her breasts via web cam, and then attempted to use the captured images to extort money and more images. Parsons was filmed engaging in what police concluded was consensual sex with several teenage boys at a house party. The cell phone video was posted on the Internet, making Parsons a victim of “sexting.” In 2014, the Supreme Court of Canada fired a shot across the bow of Bill C-30, the immediate predecessor to the Protecting Canadians from Online Crime Act, ruling that a police search (permissible under Bill C-30) in a child pornography case infringed upon constitutional protection against unreasonable search and seizure, and upon the right to privacy in cyberspace. In 2015, the Cyber-Safety Act of Nova Scotia was struck down by the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia because it violated constitutional rights to freedom of expression and to life, liberty and security of person. In a criminal harassment case involving Twitter, the Ontario Court of Justice ruled in 2016 that Twitter is like a public square, where freedom of expression is protected, and where there is no reasonable expectation of privacy. These three court decisions can be expected to limit the extent to which Canadian legislators and law enforcement agencies can go in their efforts to pursue and prosecute cyberbullies and/or cyber criminals.","","978-1-5090-6096-2","10.1109/ICCCF.2016.7740430","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7740430","cyberbullying;Canadian cyber law;sexting;capping;freedom of expression;right to privacy","Law enforcement;Internet;Privacy;Cyberspace;Legislation","","4","","36","IEEE","17 Nov 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are two reasons for this gap: first, States are traditionally reluctant to publicly discuss or internationally regulate sharing of information with partners. Second, the law of neutrality has become a niche discipline in the past years when major international armed conflicts (IAC) were often considered to be passé. However, in today’s digitalized societies, information has acquired a value similar to physical goods. Supporting a belligerent with data may therefore be just as problematic from a neutrality perspective as delivering weapons. This paper discusses the important implications of the law of neutrality for neutral States to share data obtained in cyberspace. After introducing a neutrality framework that takes contemporary State practice into account, I illustrate that the discussions on neutrality in the context of the Russia-Ukraine war are neither new nor unaddressed. A short case study will outline the inherent tensions between a neutral State’s impartiality and its preventive obligations. Weighing these two factors in the context of an interconnected, cyber-driven security landscape, I argue that during an IAC, a neutral has the ability, but not the obligation, to share certain information with selected partners. However, this does not include militarily actionable data, as such sharing would violate the neutral State’s fundamental impartiality obligations.","2325-5374","978-9916-9789-3-1","10.23919/CyCon58705.2023.10181885","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10181885","law of neutrality;cyber-enabled data;data sharing;impartiality;prevention","Weapons;Government;Information sharing;Cyberspace;Security","","1","","0","","19 Jul 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Consequently, the state of human rights to the people of Bangladesh is still very vulnerable compared to some other countries in the world. In order to protect these rights, meanwhile, the Government of Bangladesh has passed some important national and international laws and policies including the Right to Information Act, 2009; the National Human Rights Commission Act, 2008 etc. Some international legal foundations and efforts such as the Earth Summit Conference, Johannesburg Conference, Rio Declaration etc; have been been made in this regard. But due to some practical constraints and reasons in the administration such as lack of daily basis transparency and accountability, non cordination, corrupt mentality, lack of enforcement and implementation, insufficient technical and research knowledge, inadequate penal provision, bureaucratic mentality, ignorance of civil society's initiatives and opinions and over all weak judiciary etc., are responsible for it.

However, high system throughput does not necessarily translate to good delay performance. Recent studies show that exponential backoff, the key collision avoidance mechanism in distributed coordination function (DCF) of 802.11, is fundamentally defected in the sense that it induces divergent moments of medium access delay. Essentially, the medium access delay follows a power law distribution, a subclass of heavy tailed distribution. With practical system configurations, the delay variance can easily approach infinity, which translates to service starvation of some users and eventually leads to severe unfairness among users. In this paper, we show that the power law delay distribution can be mitigated if exponential backoff is replaced by a polynomial backoff mechanism. Through rigorous analysis, we find that all delay moments are finite with polynomial backoff, thus fundamentally solving the problem of starvation and unfairness. In addition, polynomial backoff yields a similarly high throughput as exponential backoff with a practical network size when the order of the polynomial backoff function is set reasonably. In this sense, we argue that polynomial backoff is a better alternative than exponential backoff in IEEE 802.11 DCF, especially when there are increasingly more broadband multimedia traffics with stringent delay requirements in the network.","1938-1883","978-1-4577-2053-6","10.1109/ICC.2012.6363967","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6363967","","Delay;Throughput;Polynomials;IEEE 802.11 Standards;Convergence;Wireless LAN","","","","14","IEEE","29 Nov 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The law and policy program (D-DCRCLPP) of the data-to-decisions cooperative research center provides examples of the various ways that regulation affects the economy and, in turn, living standards. As a result, only a limited amount of capital, labor, and technology may be used in the production process. Regulation, when done incorrectly, has the potential to stifle innovation and learning while also limiting opportunities for everyone. Big Data technology (BDT) has been studied, with a focus on privacy and data protection techniques, which led to the formulation of this policy proposal based on privacy law (PL). Several perspectives are provided, each with benefits and weaknesses. These perspectives come from the domains of governance, law, economics, and information science. Enormous, linked, and information sharing are multifaceted ways that necessitate the use of a variety of technologies to promote and protect people's economic and political rights. Existing and emerging rules of international economic law have an indirect impact on such projects. New regulations for digital commerce are meant to ensure global data mobility. At the same time, international investment law will most likely be used to defend governments attempting to compel data sharing from private data holders. For these reasons, international economic law limits governments' ability to cope with asymmetric data ownership while promoting information holders' right to preserve control over data placement and utilization. Finally, recommendations are offered to foster a broader conversation, resulting in an overall performance of 96.7%.","","979-8-3315-3496-7","10.1109/ICERCS63125.2024.10895428","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10895428","Big Data;Technology;Economic Law;and privacy;Regulation of Economic","Economics;Industries;Data privacy;Technological innovation;Privacy;Big Data;Regulation;Internet of Things;Protection;Standards","","","","15","IEEE","27 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"10 Was It Good for You Too? The New Natural Law Theory and the Paradoxical Good of Sexbots","J. Danaher; N. McArthur",NA; NA,Robot Sex: Social and Ethical Implications,"","2017","","","173","200","The New Natural Law Theory (NNLT), associated with thinkers such as Germain Grisez, John Finnis, and Robert George, has emerged as a noted, if not prominent, force in ethical theory since the 1960s. It is an attempt to revive and update Thomistic philosophy to meet modern moral challenges. If we think of NNLT at all, it is both for its complex moral theory of how sex and human fulfillment fit together, and for the rather limited set of human sexual acts and decisions that fit within the moral horizon it sketches. Within this horizon falls “reproductive-type” sex, but only insofar as it occurs within and for the sake of different-sex marriage. Irretrievably beyond that horizon for the NNLT sexual ethic is masturbation, all reproductive-type sex outside of or only contingently related to marriage (e.g., “adultery,” “fornication”), and all complete sex of an intrinsically non-reproductive-type regardless of the relational or physical configuration it takes (e.g., “sodomy,” oral, or contracepted sex).1 On the face of it, then, an account of sexbots based on the NNLT sexual ethic promises to be brief. The mere existence of sexbots would seem to signal that our relations with them are going to be masturbatory, certainly non-reproductive, and a simulation of adultery (if we are married) or fornication (if we are not). In other words, sexbots simply would appear to be outside the NNLT's moral horizon. In terms of new and interesting moral insights into sexbots, a NNLT account seems to promise only its rather sophisticated (some might say “casuistical”2) reasoning for these wrongs and how they apply to sex with robots.","","9780262341981","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8232960.pdf&bkn=8169742&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","25 Dec 2017","","","MIT Press","MIT Press eBook Chapters"

In the present paper, we separately estimate intrinsic and scattering Q−1 parameters, using the classical multiple lapse time window analysis (MLTWA) approach in the assumption of a half-space model. The results clearly show that the attenuation parameters Qi−1 and Qs−1 are frequency dependent. This estimate is compared with other attenuation studies carried out in the same area, and with all the other MLTWA estimates obtained till now in other tectonic environments in the Earth. The bias introduced by the half-space assumption is investigated through numerical solutions of the energy transport equation in the more realistic assumption of a heterogeneous crust overlying a transparent mantle, with a Moho located at a depth ranging between 35 and 45 km below the surface. The bias introduced by the half-space assumption is significant only at high frequency. We finally show how the attenuation estimates, calculated with different techniques, lead to different peak ground acceleration decay with distance relationships, using the well-known and well proven Boore's method. This last result indicates that care must be used in selecting the correct estimate of the attenuation parameters for seismic risk purposes. We also discuss the reason why MLTWA may be chosen among all the other available techniques, due to its intrinsic stability, to obtain the right attenuation parameters.","1365-246X","","10.1093/gji/ggv055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8188076","Coda waves;Seismic attenuation;Computational seismology;Wave scattering and diffraction","","","1","","","","18 Jan 2018","","","OUP","OUP Journals"

Nenni",NA,IEEE Circuits and Systems Magazine,"16 Jan 2023","2022","22","4","76","80","It’s time for the big ship of Moore’s Law to make a turn” is a nonconformist message that has surprised me when I first encountered this book of “The Turn of Moore’s Law from Space to Time” by Mr. Liming Xiu. There is a great number of books on Moore’s Law in the market, some of which focuses on the history side of this “Law”, some on the business aspect of this “Law”, and many more on the topics related to the technical developments of microelectronics. As a forty-year veteran in this industry and as an author of several books on semiconductor industry myself, I have seen a lot and I am quite familiar with all contemporary discussions on Moore’s Law. This book strikes me with its adventurous insight and broad view. If More Moore is regarded as Moore’s Law 1.0, More Than Moore as Moore’s Law 1.1 and Beyond Moore as Moore’s Law 1.2, then the Time Moore (to use time more, as the author explains in the book) can be considered as Moore’s Law 2.0. This is due to the reason that, in this work, Moore’s Law is investigated from the depth of two fundamental constituents of our universal: space and time; for the first time, microelectronics is inspected at its root for a potential detour to circumvent the space crisis that this field is currently facing. Physics, the progenitor of all branches of science and engineering, is the place where new insights shall be sought, as history has taught us many times. Moore’s Law 1.x is about space, Moore’s Law 2.0 focuses on time (space has however not been forgotten, as clarified by the author throughout the book).","1558-0830","","10.1109/MCAS.2022.3214589","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10018019","","Book reviews;Moore's Law;Microelectronics;History;Electronics industry;Transistors","","","","0","IEEE","16 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
