AB  - Legal texts, such as regulations and legislation, are playing an increasingly important role in requirements engineering and system development. Monitoring systems for requirements and policy compliance has been recognized in the requirements engineering community as a key area for research. Similarly, regulatory compliance is critical in systems that are governed by regulations and law, especially given that non-compliance can result in both financial and criminal penalties. Working with legal texts can be very challenging, however, because they contain numerous ambiguities, cross-references, domain-specific definitions, and acronyms, and are frequently amended via new regulations and case law. Requirements engineers and compliance auditors must be able to identify relevant regulations, extract requirements and other key concepts, and monitor compliance throughout the software lifecycle. This paper surveys research efforts over the past 50 years in handling legal texts for systems development. These efforts include the use of symbolic logic, logic programming, first-order temporal logic, deontic logic, defeasible logic, goal modeling, and semi-structured representations. This survey can aid requirements engineers and auditors to better specify, monitor, and test software systems for compliance.

AB  - In recent years, many governmental regulations have been introduced to protect the privacy of person-al information. As a result, organizations must take a systematic approach to ensure that their business processes comply with these regulations. In the past, we introduced a requirements framework that mapped regulations documents and goals to goal and scenario models of organizational processes. The intent was to help organizations document and manage the compliance of their processes in the face of evolutionary changes. In this paper, we extend our framework by incorporating regulation scenario models and by adding the notion of contribution link level to the compliance link types. These extensions result in a frame-work that is more aligned to the needs of an organization when it must evaluate and ensure the legal compliance of its organizational processes.

AB  - Governments enact laws and regulations to safeguard the security and privacy of their citizens. In response, requirements engineers must specify compliant system requirements to satisfy applicable legal security and privacy obligations. Specifying legally compliant requirements is challenging because legal texts are complex and ambiguous by nature. In this paper, we discuss our evaluation of the requirements for iTrust, an open-source Electronic Health Records system, for compliance with legal requirements governing security and privacy in the healthcare domain. We begin with an overview of the method we developed, using existing requirements engineering techniques, and then summarize our experiences in applying our method to the iTrust system. We illustrate some of the challenges that practitioners face when specifying requirements for a system that must comply with law and close with a discussion of needed future research focusing on security and privacy requirements.

AB  - There is a growing interest in establishing rules to regulate the privacy of citizens in the treatment of sensitive personal data such as medical and financial records. Such rules must be respected by software used in these sectors. The regulatory statements are somewhat informal and must be interpreted carefully in the software interface to private data. This paper describes techniques to formalize regulatory privacy rules and how to exploit this formalization to analyze the rules automatically. Our formalism, which we call privacy APIs, is an extension of access control matrix operations to include (1) operations for notification and logging and (2) constructs that ease the mapping between legal and formal language. We validate the expressive power of privacy APIs by encoding the 2000 and 2003 HIPAA consent rules in our system. This formalization is then encoded into Promela and we validate the usefulness of the formalism by using the SPIN model checker to verify properties that distinguish the two versions of HIPAA.

AB  - Information practices that use personal, financial, and health-related information are governed by US laws and regulations to prevent unauthorized use and disclosure. To ensure compliance under the law, the security and privacy requirements of relevant software systems must properly be aligned with these regulations. However, these regulations describe stakeholder rules, called rights and obligations, in complex and sometimes ambiguous legal language. These "rules" are often precursors to software requirements that must undergo considerable refinement and analysis before they become implementable. To support the software engineering effort to derive security requirements from regulations, we present a methodology for directly extracting access rights and obligations from regulation texts. The methodology provides statement-level coverage for an entire regulatory document to consistently identify and infer six types of data access constraints, handle complex cross references, resolve ambiguities, and assign required priorities between access rights and obligations to avoid unlawful information disclosures. We present results from applying this methodology to the entire regulation text of the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule.

AB  - U.S. federal and state regulations impose mandatory and discretionary requirements on industry-wide business practices to achieve non-functional, societal goals such as improved accessibility, privacy and safety. The structure and syntax of regulations affects how well software engineers identify and interpret legal requirements. Inconsistent interpretations can lead to noncompliance and violations of the law. To support software engineers who must comply with these regulations, I propose a Frame-Based Requirements Analysis Method (FBRAM) to acquire and specify legal requirements from U.S. federal regulatory documents. The legal requirements are systematically specified using a reusable, domain-independent upper ontology, natural language phrase heuristics, a regulatory document model and a frame-based markup language. The methodology maintains traceability from regulatory statements and phrases to formal properties in a frame-based model and supports the resolution of multiple types of legal ambiguity. The methodology is supported by a software prototype to assist engineers with applying the model and with analyzing legal requirements. This work is validated in three domains, information privacy, information accessibility and aviation safety, which are governed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998, and the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, respectively.

AB  - CATO is an intelligent learning environment designed to help beginning law students learn basic skills of making arguments with cases. Using CATO, students practice tasks of induction and analogical argumentation. They practice testing theories against a body of cases and making written arguments about a problem, comparing and contrasting it to past cases.
CATO's model addresses arguments in which two opponents analogize a problem to favorable cases, distinguish unfavorable cases, assess the significance of similarities and differences between cases in light of normative knowledge about the domain, and use that knowledge to organize multi-case arguments. CATO communicates the model to students by presenting dynamically-generated argumentation examples and by reifying argument structure based on the model. CATO also provides a case database and tools based on the model that help make students' tasks more manageable.
CATO was evaluated in the context of an actual legal writing course, in a study involving 30 first-year law students. We found that instruction with CATO leads to statistically significant improvement in students' basic argumentation skills, comparable to that achieved by an experienced legal writing instructor teaching groups of 4-10 students. However, on a more advanced legal writing assignment, meant to explore the frontier of the CATO instruction, students taught by the legal writing instructor had higher grades, suggesting a need for more integrated practice with the CATO model.
CATO contributes to AI research fields modeling educational techniques as well as case-based and legal reasoning. It is a novel result that students can learn basic argumentation skills by studying computer-generated examples. It means that an instructional system does not necessarily need to rely on a very sophisticated understanding of students' arguments, which would be a significant obstacle to developing such systems.
Also, CATO presents novel techniques for using background knowledge to support similarity assessment in case-based reasoning. Drawing on its background knowledge, CATO characterizes and re-characterizes cases in order to argue that two cases are similar or different. This is an important skill in the legal domain not previously modeled. CATO's arguments may help a user in assessing the similarity of cases in a more discriminatory way.

AB  - This dissertation is about adversarial, case-based reasoning and the HYPO program that performs adversarial reasoning with cases and hypotheticals in the legal domain. The dissertation identifies and describes basic case-based operations, an adversarial, case-based reasoning process, a schematic structure for case-based arguments, the kinds of counter-examples that arise and the knowledge sources necessary to support adversarial, case-based reasoning.
The HYPO program embodies the methodology. It comprises: (1) a structured Case Knowledge Base ("CKB") of actual legal cases; (2) an indexing scheme ("dimensions") for retrieval of relevant cases from the CKB; (3) methods for analyzing problem situations and retrieving relevant cases; (4) methods for interpreting and assessing the relevancy of past cases by "positioning" the problem situation with respect to relevant existing cases in the CKB as seen from the viewpoint of the problem at hand and finding the most-on-point cases; (5) methods for comparing/contrasting cases (e.g., citing, distinguishing, finding counter-examples); (6) methods for posing hypotheticals that test the sensitivity of the problem situation to changes, particularly with regard to potentially adverse effects of new damaging facts coming to light and existing favorable ones being discredited; (7) methods for generating "3-ply" argument outlines to play out realistic legal arguments citing cases in a manner familiar to attorneys; and (8) methods for explaining alternative decisions of the problem situation by posing hypotheticals, comparing arguments and summarizing the precedents. HYPO's performance compares favorably to that of judges and attorneys in actual legal cases.
The law is an excellent domain to study case-based reasoning since by its very nature it: (1) espouses a doctrine of precedent in which prior cases are the primary tools for justifying legal conclusions; and (2) employs precedential reasoning to make up for the lack of strong domain models with which to reason deductively about problem situations. The law is also a paradigm for adversarial case-based reasoning; there are "no right answers", only arguments pitting interpretations of cases and facts against each other.
The dissertation addresses issues of central concern to Artificial Intelligence including: relevance and credit assignment, indexing and inference control, argumentation, analogical reasoning and explanation.

AB  - This paper analyses legal reasoning with precedents in the setting of a formally defined dialogue game. After giving a legal-theoretical account of judicial reasoning with precedents, a formal method is proposed for representing precedents and it is discussed how such representations can be used in a formally defined dialectical protocol for dispute. The basic ideas are to represent cases as argument structures (including pro and con arguments, and the arguments for adjudicating their conflicts) and to define certain case-based reasoning moves as strategies for introducing information into a dispute. In particular, analogizing and distinguishing are conceived as elementary theory construction moves, which produce new information on the basis of an existing stock of cases. The approach also offers the possibility of using portions of precedents and of expressing criteria for determining the outcome of precedent-based disputes.

AB  - Hospitals strive to improve the quality of the healthcare they provide. To achieve this, they require access to health data. These data are sensitive since they contain personal information. Governments have legislation to ensure that privacy is respected and hospitals must comply with it. Unfortunately, most of the procedures meant to control access to health information remain paper-based, making it difficult to trace. In this paper, we introduce a framework based on the User Requirements Notation that models the business processes of a hospital and links them with legislation such as the Ontario Personal Health Information Privacy Act (PHIPA). We analyze different types of links, their functionality, and usefulness in complying with privacy law. This framework will help health information custodians track compliance and indicate how their business processes can be improved.

Unlike the predictions generated by statistical or machine-learning techniques, IBP's predictions are accompanied by explanations.We describe an empirical evaluation of IBP, in which we compare our algorithm to prediction based on Hypo's and CATO's relevance criteria, and to a number of widely used machine learning algorithms. IBP reaches higher accuracy than all competitors, and hypothesis testing shows that the observed differences are statistically significant. An ablation study indicates that both sources of knowledge in IBP contribute to the accuracy of its predictions.

First, we discuss how the requirements of argument guide the specification and selection of supporting cases and how an existing case base influences argument formation. Second, we present,our evolving taxonomy of patterns of actual legal argument. This taxonomy builds upon our much earlier work on `argument moves" and also on our more recent analysis of how cases are used to support arguments for the interpretation of legal statutes. Third, we show how the theory of argument used by CABARET, a hybrid case-based/rule-based reasoner, can support many of the argument patterns in our taxonomy.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to study the fundamental mechanism, humans use in argumentation, and to explore ways to implement this mechanism on computers. We do so by first developing a theory for argumentation whose central notion is the acceptability of arguments. Then we argue for the “correctness” or “appropriateness” of our theory with two strong arguments. The first one shows that most of the major approaches to nonmonotonic reasoning in AI and logic programming are special forms of our theory of argumentation. The second argument illustrates how our theory can be used to investigate the logical structure of many practical problems. This argument is based on a result showing that our theory captures naturally the solutions of the theory of n-person games and of the well-known stable marriage problem. By showing that argumentation can be viewed as a special form of logic programming with negation as failure, we introduce a general logic-programming-based method for generating meta-interpreters for argumentation systems, a method very much similar to the compiler-compiler idea in conventional programming.

AB  - Legal compliance has been an active topic in Software Engineering and Information Systems for many years. However, business analysts and others recently started exploiting Requirements Engineering techniques, and in particular goal-oriented approaches, to model and reason about legal documents in system design and business process management. Many contributions involve extracting legal requirements, providing law-compliant business processes, as well as managing and maintaining compliance. In this paper, we report on a systematic literature review focusing on goal-oriented legal compliance of business processes. 88 papers were selected out of nearly 800 unique papers extracted from five search engines, with manual additions from the Requirements Engineering Journal and four relevant conferences. We grouped these papers in eight categories based on a set of criteria and then highlight their main contributions. We found that the main areas for contributions have been in extracting legal requirements, modeling them with goal modeling languages, and integrating them with business processes. We identify gaps and opportunities for future work in areas related to prioritization to improve compliance, templates for generating law-compliant processes, general links between legal requirements, goal models, and business processes, and semi-automation of legal compliance and analysis.

AB  - In many cases of disagreement, particularly in situations involving practical reasoning, it is impossible to demonstrate conclusively that either party is wrong. The role of argument in such cases is to persuade rather than to prove, demonstrate or refute. Following Perelman, we argue that persuasion in such cases relies on a recognition that the strength of an argument depends on the social values that it advances, and that whether the attack of one argument on another succeeds depends on the comparative strength of the values advanced by the arguments concerned. To model this we extend the standard notion of Argumentation Frameworks (AFs) to Value-based Argumentation Frameworks (VAFs). After defining VAFs we explore their properties, and show how they can provide a rational basis for the acceptance or rejection of arguments, even where this would appear to be a matter of choice in a standard AF .I n particular we show that in a VAF certain arguments can be shown to be acceptable however the relative strengths of the values involved are assessed. This means that disputants can concur on the acceptance of arguments, even when they differ as to which values are more important, and hence that we can identify points for which persuasion should be possible. We illustrate the above using an example moral debate. We then show how factual considerations can be admitted to our framework and discuss the possibility of persuasion in the face of uncertainty and disagreement as to values.

AB  - In this paper we describe AGATHA, a program designed to automate the process of theory construction in case based domains. Given a seed case and a number of precedent cases, the program uses a set of argument moves to generate a search space for a dialogue between the parties to the dispute. Each move is associated with a set of theory constructors, and thus each point in the space can be associated with a theory intended to explain the seed case and the other cases in the domain. The space is large and so an heuristic search method is needed. This paper describes two methods based on A* and alpha/beta pruning and also a series of experiments designed to explore the appropriateness of different evaluation functions, the most useful precedents to use as seed cases and the quality of the resulting theories.

The study of these schemes, or forms of argument that capture stereotypical patterns of human reasoning, is at the core of argumentation research. Surveying all aspects of argumentation schemes from the ground up, the book takes the reader from the elementary exposition in the first chapter to the latest state of the art in the research efforts to formalize and classify the schemes, outlined in the last chapter. It provides a systematic and comprehensive account, with notation suitable for computational applications that increasingly make use of argumentation schemes.

AB  - This chapter explains the role of proof burdens and standards in argumentation, illustrates them using legal procedures, and surveys the history of research on computational models of these concepts. It also presents an original computational model which aims to integrate the features of these prior systems. The ‘mainstream’ conception of argumentation in the field of artificial intelligence is monological and deductive [6]. Argumentation is viewed as taking place against the background of an inconsistent knowledge base, where the knowledge base is a set of propositions represented in some formal logic. Argumentation in this conception is a method for deducing warranted propositions from an inconsistent knowledge base. Which statements are warranted depends on attack relations among the arguments [10] which can be constructed from the knowledge base. The notions of proof standards and burden of proof become relevant only when argumentation is viewed as a dialogical process for making justified decisions. The input to the process is an initial claim or issue. The goal of the process is to clarify and decide the issues, and produce a justification of the decision which can withstand a critical evaluation by a particular audience. The role of the audience could be played by the respondent or a neutral-third party, depending on the type of dialogue. The output of this process consists of: 1) a set of claims, 2) the decision to accept or reject each claim, 3) a theory of the generalizations of the domain and the facts of the particular case, and 4) a proof justifying the decision of each issues, showing how the decision is supported by the theory. Notice that a theory or knowledge-base is part of the output of argumentation dialogues, not, as in the deductive conception, its input. This is because, as has been

AB  - Companies that own, license, or maintain personal information face a daunting number of privacy and security regulations. Companies are subject to new regulations from one or more governing bodies, when companies introduce new or existing products into a jurisdiction, when regulations change, or when data is transferred across political borders. To address this problem, we developed a framework called “requirements water marking” that business analysts can use to align and reconcile requirements from multiple jurisdictions (municipalities, provinces, nations) to produce a single high or low standard of care. We evaluate the framework in an empirical case study conducted over a subset of U.S. data breach notification laws that require companies to secure their data and notify consumers in the event of data loss or theft. In this study, applying our framework reduced the number of requirements a company must comply with by 76% across 8 jurisdictions. We show how the framework surfaces critical requirements trade-offs and potential regulatory conflicts that companies must address during the reconciliation process. We summarize our results, including surveys of information technology law experts to contextualize our empirical results in legal practice.

AB  - In this paper we describe an approach to practical reasoning, reasoning about what it is best for a particular agent to do in a given situation, based on presumptive justifications of action through the instantiation of an argument scheme, which is then subject to examination through a series of critical questions. We identify three particular aspects of practical reasoning which distinguish it from theoretical reasoning. We next provide an argument scheme and an associated set of critical questions which is able to capture these features. In order that both the argument scheme and the critical questions can be given precise interpretations we use the semantic structure of an Action-Based Alternating Transition System as the basis for their definition. We then work through a detailed example to show how this approach to practical reasoning can be applied to a problem solving situation, and briefly describe some other previous applications of the general approach. In a second example we relate our account to the social laws paradigm for co-ordinating multi-agent systems. The contribution of the paper is to provide firm foundations for an approach to practical reasoning based on presumptive argument in terms of a well-known model for representing the effects of actions of a group of agents.

AB  - Modelling reasoning with legal cases has been a central concern of AI and Law since the 1980s. The approach which represents cases as factors and dimensions has been a central part of that work. In this paper I consider how several varieties of the approach can be applied to the interesting case of Popov v Hayashi. After briefly reviewing some of the key landmarks of the approach, the case is represented in terms of factors and dimensions, and further explored using theory construction and argumentation schemes approaches.

AB  - Requirements prioritization is used in the early phases of software development to determine the order in which requirements should be implemented. Requirements are not all equally important to the final software system because time constraints, expense, and design can each raise the urgency of implementing some requirements before others. Laws and regulations can make requirements prioritization particularly challenging due to the high costs of noncompliance and the substantial amount of domain knowledge needed to make prioritization decisions. In the context of legal requirements, implementation order ideally should be influenced by the laws and regulations governing a given software system. In this paper, we present a prioritization technique for legal requirements. We apply our technique on a set of 63 functional requirements for an open-source electronic health records system that must comply with the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.

AB  - Inspired by legal reasoning, this paper presents a formal framework for assessing conflicting arguments. Its use is illustrated with applications to realistic legal examples, and the potential for implementation is discussed. The framework has the form of a logical system for defeasible argumentation. Its language, which is of a logic-programming-like nature, has both weak and explicit negation, and conflicts between arguments are decided with the help of priorities on the rules. An important feature of the system is that these priorities are not fixed, but are themselves defeasibly derived as conclusions within the system. Thus debates on the choice between conflicting arguments can also be modelled.

The proof theory of the system is stated in dialectical style, where a proof takes the form of a dialogue between a proponent and an opponent of an argument. An argument is shown to be justified if the proponent can make the opponent run out of moves in whatever way the opponent attacks. Despite this dialectical form, the system reflects a `declarative', or `relational' approach to modelling legal argument. A basic assumption of this paper is that this approach complements two other lines of research in AI and Law, investigations of precedent-based reasoning and the development of `procedural', or `dialectical' models of legal argument.

AB  - The investigation described in this paper is part of a larger project to characterize and develop computational tools to help people formulate, record, and present arguments and rationale in diverse domains such as law, policy, and design where argumentation and decision-making are fundamental processes. To build such tools, it is necessary first to design a uniform representation for the structure of arguments; law has provided us with a good starting point for understanding this structure. Since arguments are important legal artifacts, law maintains a recorded institutional memory of them in forms such as casebooks, databases, and courtroom transcripts. This analysis is primarily concerned with the arguments that occur in two excerpts from Supreme Court oral argument transcripts; it is directed toward developing a system of semi-formal representations of the structure of these arguments in hypertext. A system of representations of argument structure, coupled with an understanding of the argumentation process, can be used to form the basis for tools for authoring, fault-detection, and other activities associated with formulating and presenting rationale.

AB  - The BankXX system models the process of perusing and gathering information for argument as a heuristic best-first search for relevant cases, theories, and other domain-specific information. As BankXX searches its heterogeneous and highly interconnected network of domain knowledge, information is incrementally analyzed and amalgamated into a dozen desirable ingredients for argument (called argument pieces), such as citations to cases, applications of legal theories, and references to prototypical factual scenarios. At the conclusion of the search, BankXX outputs the set of argument pieces filled with harvested material relevant to the input problem situation.

This research explores the appropriateness of the search paradigm as a framework for harvesting and mining information needed to make legal arguments. In this article, we describe how legal research fits the heuristic search framework and detail how this model is used in BankXX. We describe the BankXX program with emphasis on its representation of legal knowledge and legal argument. We describe the heuristic search mechanism and evaluation functions that drive the program. We give an extended example of the processing of BankXX on the facts of an actual legal case in BankXX's application domain -- the good faith question of Chapter 13 personal bankruptcy law. We discuss closely related research on legal knowledge representation and retrieval and the use of search for case retrieval or tasks related to argument creation. Finally we review what we believe are the contributions of this research to the understanding of the diverse disciplines it addresses.

AB  - Contextual integrity is a conceptual framework for understanding privacy expectations and their implications developed in the literature on law, public policy, and political philosophy. We formalize some aspects of contextual integrity in a logical framework for expressing and reasoning about norms of transmission of personal information. In comparison with access control and privacy policy frameworks such as RBAC, EPAL, and P3P, these norms focus on who personal information is about, how it is transmitted, and past and future actions by both the subject and the users of the information. Norms can be positive or negative depending on whether they refer to actions that are allowed or disallowed. Our model is expressive enough to capture naturally many notions of privacy found in legislation, including those found in HIPAA, COPPA, and GLBA. A number of important problems regarding compliance with privacy norms, future requirements associated with specific actions, and relations between policies and legal standards reduce to standard decision procedures for temporal logic.

AB  - This article gives a tutorial introduction to the ASPIC+ framework for structured argumentation. The philosophical and conceptual underpinnings of ASPIC+ are discussed, the main definitions are illustrated with examples and several ways are discussed to instantiate the framework and to reconstruct other approaches as special cases of the framework. The ASPIC+ framework is based on two ideas: the first is that conflicts between arguments are often resolved with explicit preferences, and the second is that arguments are built with two kinds of inference rules: strict, or deductive rules, whose premises guarantee their conclusion, and defeasible rules, whose premises only create a presumption in favour of their conclusion. Accordingly, arguments can in ASPIC+ be attacked in three ways: on their uncertain premises, or on their defeasible inferences, or on the conclusions of their defeasible inferences. ASPIC+ is not a system but a framework for specifying systems. A main objective of the study of the ASPIC+ f...

AB  - This article reviews formal systems that regulate persuasion dialogues. In such dialogues two or more participants aim to resolve a difference of opinion, each trying to persuade the other participants to adopt their point of view. Systems for persuasion dialogue have found application in various fields of computer science, such as non-monotonic logic, artificial intelligence and law, multi-agent systems, intelligent tutoring and computer-supported collaborative argumentation. Taking a game-theoretic view on dialogue systems, this review proposes a formal specification of the main elements of dialogue systems for persuasion and then uses it to critically review some of the main formal systems for persuasion. The focus of this review will be on regulating the interaction between agents rather than on the design and behaviour of individual agents within a dialogue.

AB  - We present a formal, mathematical model of argument structure and evaluation, taking seriously the procedural and dialogical aspects of argumentation. The model applies proof standards to determine the acceptability of statements on an issue-by-issue basis. The model uses different types of premises (ordinary premises, assumptions and exceptions) and information about the dialectical status of statements (stated, questioned, accepted or rejected) to allow the burden of proof to be allocated to the proponent or the respondent, as appropriate, for each premise separately. Our approach allows the burden of proof for a premise to be assigned to a different party than the one who has the burden of proving the conclusion of the argument, and also to change the burden of proof or applicable proof standard as the dialogue progresses from stage to stage. Useful for modeling legal dialogues, the burden of production and burden of persuasion can be handled separately, with a different responsible party and applicable proof standard for each. Carneades enables critical questions of argumentation schemes to be modeled as additional premises, using premise types to capture the varying effect on the burden of proof of different kinds of questions.

AB  - U.S. laws and regulations are designed to support broad societal goals, such as accessibility, privacy and safety. To demonstrate that a product complies with these goals, businesses need to identify and refine legal requirements into product requirements and integrate the product requirements into their ongoing product design and testing processes. We report on an industry case study in which product requirements were specified to comply with Section 508 of the U.S. Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1998. This study sought to identify: limitations in existing requirements-acquisition methods; compliance gaps between previously specified product requirements and Section 508; and additional sources of knowledge that are necessary to refine legal requirements into product requirements to comply with the law. Our study reveals the need for a community of practice and generalizable techniques that can reduce ambiguity, complexity and redundancy in legal and product requirements and manage innovation in product requirements. We present these findings with several examples from Section 508 regulations and actual product requirements that are implemented in Cisco products.

AB  - Defeasible Logic is a promising representation for legal knowledge that appears to overcome many of the deficiencies of previous approaches to representing legal knowledge. Unfortunately, an immediate application of technology to the challenges of generating theories in the legal domain is an expensive and computationally intractable problem. So, in light of the potential benefits, we seek to find a practical algorithm that uses heuristics to discover an approximate solution. As an outcome of this work, we have developed an algorithm that integrates defeasible logic into a decision support system by automatically deriving its knowledge from databases of precedents. Experiments with the new algorithm are very promising -- delivering results comparable to and exceeding other approaches.

In particular, we provide a reconstruction of the reasoning of the majority and dissenting opinions for a particular well-known case from property law. This is done through the use of Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents to replicate the contrasting views involved in the actual decision. This reconstruction suggests that the reasoning involved can be separated into three distinct levels: factual and normative levels and a level connecting the two, with conclusions at one level forming premises at the next. We begin by summarising our general approach, which uses instantiations of an argumentation scheme to provide presumptive justifications for actions, and critical questions to identify arguments which attack these justifications. These arguments and attacks are organised into argumentation frameworks to identify the status of individual arguments. We then discuss the levels of reasoning that occur in this reconstruction and the properties and significance of each of these levels. We illustrate the different levels with short examples and also include a discussion of the role of precedents within these levels of reasoning.

AB  - In this paper we attempt to give an account of reasoning with legal cases contextualised within a general theory of persuasion in practical reasoning. We begin by presenting our general theory, concentrating on the variety of ways in which a particular position can be attacked. We then apply our theory to the legal domain, illustrating our approach by a case study based on the well known CATO system. From this we conclude that it is possible to see reasoning with legal cases as a particular instantiation of our general theory. We identify some points of interest for discussion, and conclude by stating our intended directions for future work.

AB  - While new laws and regulations address organisations, with their processes and information systems, the problem of defining suitable methods and techniques to support the design of law-compliant systems is getting increasing attention. We proposed a novel requirements engineering framework that includes a systematic process to derive law-compliant system requirements taking into account laws and strategic goals of stakeholders of a given domain. In this paper, we focus on the conceptual meta-model this framework rests on, defining it and discussing its use.

These schemes, and undercutting attacks associated with them, are formalized as defeasible rules of inference within the ASPIC+ framework. We begin by modelling the style of reasoning with cases developed by Aleven and Ashley in the CATO project, which describes cases using factors, and then extend the account to accommodate the dimensions used in Rissland and Ashley's earlier HYPO project. Some additional scope for argumentation is then identified and formalized.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A software engineering systematic map is a defined method to build a classification scheme and structure a software engineering field of interest. The analysis of results focuses on frequencies of publications for categories within the scheme. Thereby, the coverage of the research field can be determined. Different facets of the scheme can also be combined to answer more specific research questions.

OBJECTIVE: We describe how to conduct a systematic mapping study in software engineering and provide guidelines. We also compare systematic maps and systematic reviews to clarify how to chose between them. This comparison leads to a set of guidelines for systematic maps.

METHOD: We have defined a systematic mapping process and applied it to complete a systematic mapping study. Furthermore, we compare systematic maps with systematic reviews by systematically analyzing existing systematic reviews.

RESULTS: We describe a process for software engineering systematic mapping studies and compare it to systematic reviews. Based on this, guidelines for conducting systematic maps are defined.

CONCLUSIONS: Systematic maps and reviews are different in terms of goals, breadth, validity issues and implications. Thus, they should be used complementarily and require different methods (e.g., for analysis).

AB  - Carneades is a rather general framework for argumentation. Unlike many other approaches, Carneades captures a number of aspects, like proof burdens, proof standards etc., which are of central importance, in particular in legal argumentation.

In this paper we show how Carneades argument evaluation structures can be reconstructed as abstract dialectical frameworks (ADFs), a recently proposed generalization of Dung argumentation frameworks (AFs). This not only provides at least an indirect link between Carneades and AFs, it also allows us to handle arbitrary argument cycles, thus lifting a restriction of Carneades. At the same time it provides strong evidence for the usefulness of ADFs as analytical/semantical tools in argumentation.

AB  - In this article I argue for rule-based, non-monotonic theories of common law judicial reasoning and improve upon one such theory offered by Horty and Bench-Capon. The improvements reveal some of the interconnections between formal theories of judicial reasoning and traditional issues within jurisprudence regarding the notions of the ratio decidendi and obiter dicta. Though I do not purport to resolve the long-standing jurisprudential issues here, it is beneficial for theorists both of legal philosophy and formalizing legal reasoning to see where the two projects interact.

AB  - Computational models of relevance in case-based legal reasoning have traditionallybeen based on algorithms for comparing the facts and substantive legal issues of aprior case to those of a new case. In this paper we argue that robust models ofcase-based legal reasoning must also consider the broader social and jurisprudentialcontext in which legal precedents are decided. We analyze three aspects of legalcontext: the teleological relations that connect legal precedents to the socialvalues and policies they serve, the temporal relations between prior andsubsequent cases in a legal domain, and the procedural posture of legal cases,which defines the scope of their precedential relevance. Using real examples drawnfrom appellate courts of New York and Massachusetts, we show with the courts' ownarguments that the doctrine of stare decisis (i.e., similar facts should lead to similar results) is subject to contextual constraints and influences. For each of the three aspects of legal context, we outline an expanded computational framework for case-based legal reasoning that encompasses the reasoning of the examples, and provides a foundation for generating a more robust set of legal arguments.

A full specification is given and an implementation, allowing the game to be played by human players, is described.

AB  - New laws, such as HIPAA and SOX, are increasingly impacting the design of software systems, as business organisations strive to comply. This paper studies the problem of generating a set of requirements for a new system which comply with a given law. Specifically, the paper proposes a systematic process for generating law-compliant requirements by using a taxonomy of legal concepts and a set of primitives to describe stakeholders and their strategic goals. Given a model of law and a model of stakeholders goals, legal alternatives are identified and explored. Strategic goals that can realise legal prescriptions are systematically analysed, and alternative ways of fulfilling a law are evaluated. The approach is demonstrated by means of a case study. This work is part of the Nomos framework, intended to support the design of law-compliant requirements models.

So, given a background of factors andvalues, the parties in a case canbuild their theories by using a set of operators,which are called theory constructors.The objective of each party is to provide theoriesthat both explain the evidence (theprecedents) and support the decision wished by thatparty. This leads to theory-basedargumentation, i.e., a dialectical exchange ofcompeting theories, which support opposedoutcomes by explaining the same evidence and appealingto the same values. The winneris the party that can reply with a more coherent theoryto all theories of its adversary.

AB  - Government regulations are increasingly affecting the security, privacy and governance of information systems in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. Consequently, companies and software developers are required to ensure that their software systems comply with relevant regulations, either through design or re-engineering. We previously proposed a methodology for extracting stakeholder requirements, called rights and obligations, from regulations. In this paper, we examine the challenges to developing tool support for this methodology using the Cerno framework for textual semantic annotation. We present the results from two empirical evaluations of a tool called "Gaius T." that is implemented using the Cerno framework and that extracts a conceptual model from regulatory texts. The evaluation, carried out on the U.S. HIPAA Privacy Rule and the Italian accessibility law, measures the quality of the produced models and the tool's effectiveness in reducing the human effort to derive requirements from regulations.

The formalisation of accrual as inference is contrasted to knowledge-representation treatments of accrual. Also, the formalisation is applied to some concepts from the theory of evidential legal reasoning.

AB  - We describe and discuss the use of semantics-based citation networks in a new legal research tool. Such networks are generated based on citation relations between cases found in legal corpora as well as legal issues being discussed with these citations. Unlike traditional tools, the System allows legal professionals to efficiently study legal issues without having to go through whole cases or tedious manual citation search. This shift of focus from cases to individual issues within cases would greatly reduce time required for attorneys and legal scholars who have specific research problems in mind.   The Systems User Interface (UI) allows users to easily navigate in the citation networks and study how citations are interrelated and how legal issues have evolved in the past. Various forms of natural language processing (NLP) technologies are used in building the metadata behind the prototype. Formal evaluation confirmed the Systems capability of accurately identifying citations relevant to given legal issues.

AB  - A formal two-phase model of democratic policy deliberation is presented, in which in the first phase sufficient and necessary criteria for proposals to be accepted are determined (the `acceptable' criteria) and in the second phase proposals are made and evaluated in light of the acceptable criteria resulting from the first phase. Such a separation gives the discussion a clear structure and prevents time and resources from being wasted on evaluating arguments for proposals based on unacceptable criteria. Argument schemes for both phases are defined and formalised in a logical framework for structured argumentation. The process of deliberation is abstracted from and it is assumed that both deliberation phases result in a set of arguments and attack and defeat relations between them. The acceptability status of criteria and proposals within the resulting argumentation framework is then evaluated using preferred semantics. For cases where preferences are required to choose between proposals, inference rules for deriving preferences between sets from an ordering of their elements are given.

AB  - Companies must ensure their software complies with relevant laws and regulations to avoid the risk of costly penalties, lost reputation, and brand damage resulting from non-compliance. Laws and regulations contain internal cross-references to portions of the same legal text, as well as cross-references to external legal texts. These cross-references introduce ambiguities, exceptions, as well as other challenges to regulatory compliance. Requirements engineers need guidance as to how to address cross-references in order to comply with the requirements of the law. Herein, we analyze each external cross-reference within the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule, the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act (GLBA), and the GLBA Financial Privacy Rule to determine whether a cross-reference either introduces a conflicting requirement, a conflicting definition, or refines an existing requirement. Herein, we propose a legal cross-reference taxonomy to aid requirements engineers in classifying cross-references as they specify compliance requirements. Analyzing cross-references enables us to address conflicting requirements that may otherwise thwart legal compliance. We identify five sets of conflicting compliance requirements and recommend strategies for resolving these conflicts.

AB  - Over time, laws change to meet evolving social needs. Requirements engineers that develop software for regulated domains, such as healthcare or finance, must adapt their software as laws change to maintain legal compliance. In the United States, regulatory agencies will almost always release a proposed regulation, or rule, and accept comments from the public. The agency then considers these comments when drafting a final rule that will be binding on the regulated domain. Herein, we examine how these proposed rules evolve into final rules, and propose an Adaptability Framework. This framework can aid software engineers in predicting what areas of a proposed rule are most likely to evolve, allowing engineers to begin building towards the more stable sections of the rule. We develop the framework through a formative study using the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability (HIPAA) Security Rule and apply it in a summative study on the Health Information Technology: Initial Set of Standards, Implementation Specifications, and Certification Criteria for Electronic Health Record Technology.

AB  - The use of computers in Canadian tax planning has until now been concentrated on numerical analysis. The computer is indeed an excellent tool for calculating tax effects where the legal results of transactions are known. However, I maintain that it can be equally useful as a tool for analysing transactions to determine what those legal results are. The complexities of the Canadian tax system are such that a given transaction could have unintended tax results, where the facts resulting from the transaction fit the words of a rule which may have been designed for, and is perceived as applying to, different circumstances altogether.  In this paper I consider the structure and form of the Income Tax Act and show how it is well-designed for computerization. I then review the primary design considerations for a computer-based tax planning system. Finally, I describe the implementation of a partial tax analysis system which I have programmed in Prolog, and review its deficiencies and the extensions which would be required to make it a useful planning tool for tax practitioners.  NOTE: this paper is a greatly condensed version of a Master of Laws (LL.M.) thesis, “Blueprint for a Computer-Based Model of the Income Tax Act of Canada”, York University, September 1986. Important detail, references and examples have been omitted due to lack of space. Interested readers are invited to contact the author for a copy of the thesis.

AB  - As software engineers create and evolve information systems to support business practices, these engineers need to address constraints imposed by laws, regulations and policies that govern those business practices. Requirements modeling can be used to extract important legal constraints from laws, and decide how, and evaluate if an information system design complies to applicable laws. To advance research on evaluating requirements modeling formalisms for the representation of legal information, we propose several benchmarks that we believe represent important challenges in modeling laws and requirements governing information systems, and evaluating the compliance of these requirements with laws. While incomplete, the proposed set of benchmarks covers a range of challenges in modeling laws and requirements that we observed in privacy and security law: from the possibility to trace model fragments to law fragments, to the ability to distinguish modalities in law, and to model relations between requirements and law fragments, needed when evaluating compliance. Benchmarks can be used as a checklist when designing and discussing requirements formalisms that support legal requirements modeling. Each benchmark is motivated by related work, a brief legal excerpt, and our experience in modeling regulations.

AB  - We discuss five kinds of representations of rationales and provide a formal account of how they can alter disputation. The formal model of disputation is derived from recent work in argument. The five kinds of rationales are compilation rationales, which can be represented without assuming domain-knowledge (such as utilities) beyond that normally required for argument. The principal thesis is that such rationales can be analyzed in a framework of argument not too different from what AI already has. The result is a formal understanding of rationales, a partial taxonomy, and a foundation for computer programs that represent and reason with rationales.

The five kinds of rationales are as follows: (c)ompression and (s)pecialization, which yield rules, and (d)isputation, which yields a decision. These are modeled as potentially changing the focus of the dispute. Then there are (f)it, a rationale for rules, and (r)esolution, a rationale for decisions. These cannot be modeled as simply; they force disputation to a meta-level, at least temporarily.

The paper first discusses each kind of rationale in the abstract. Then it produces a model of dispute in which the simpler rationales can be analyzed. Formal examples are given. The model is augmented to allow analysis of the more difficult rationales. Examples are again given. The discussion is not intended to be strictly mathematical; rather, it aims to use formal methods to illuminate and provide framework for future interpretation and implementation.

Fifty papers have been selected from the thirteen conferences and each of them is described in a short subsection individually written by one of the 24 authors. These subsections attempt to place the paper discussed in the context of the development of AI and Law, while often offering some personal reactions and reflections. As a whole, the subsections build into a history of the last quarter century of the field, and provide some insights into where it has come from, where it is now, and where it might go.

AB  - An abstract framework for structured arguments is presented, which instantiates Dung's (‘On the Acceptability of Arguments and its Fundamental Role in Nonmonotonic Reasoning, Logic Programming, and n-Person Games’, Artificial Intelligence, 77, 321–357) abstract argumentation frameworks. Arguments are defined as inference trees formed by applying two kinds of inference rules: strict and defeasible rules. This naturally leads to three ways of attacking an argument: attacking a premise, attacking a conclusion and attacking an inference. To resolve such attacks, preferences may be used, which leads to three corresponding kinds of defeat: undermining, rebutting and undercutting defeats. The nature of the inference rules, the structure of the logical language on which they operate and the origin of the preferences are, apart from some basic assumptions, left unspecified. The resulting framework integrates work of Pollock, Vreeswijk and others on the structure of arguments and the nature of defeat and extends it...

AB  - Software engineers build software systems in increasingly regulated environments, and must therefore ensure that software requirements accurately represent obligations described in laws and regulations. Prior research has shown that graduate-level software engineering students are not able to reliably determine whether software requirements meet or exceed their legal obligations and that professional software engineers are unable to accurately classify cross-references in legal texts. However, no research has determined whether software engineers are able to identify and classify important ambiguities in laws and regulations. Ambiguities in legal texts can make the difference between requirements compliance and non-compliance. Herein, we develop a ambiguity taxonomy based on software engineering, legal, and linguistic understandings of ambiguity. We examine how 17 technologists and policy analysts in a graduate-level course use this taxonomy to identify ambiguity in a legal text. We also examine the types of ambiguities they found and whether they believe those ambiguities should prevent software engineers from implementing software that complies with the legal text. Our research suggests that ambiguity is prevalent in legal texts. In 50 minutes of examination, participants in our case study identified on average 33.47 ambiguities in 104 lines of legal text using our ambiguity taxonomy as a guideline. Our analysis suggests (a) that participants used the taxonomy as intended: as a guide and (b) that the taxonomy provides adequate coverage (97.5%) of the ambiguities found in the legal text.

AB  - Much work on legal knowledge systems treats legal reasoning as arguments that lead from a description of the law and the facts of a case, to the legal conclusion for the case. The reasoning steps of the inference engine parallel the logical steps by means of which the legal conclusion is derived from the factual and legal premises. In short, the relation between the input and the output of a legal inference engine is a logical one. The truth of the conclusion only depends on the premises, and is independent of the argument that leads to the conclusion.

This paper opposes the logical approach, and defends a procedural approach to legal reasoning. Legal conclusions are not true or false independent of the reasoning process that ended in these conclusions. In critical cases this reasoning process consists of an adversarial procedure in which several parties are involved. The course of the argument determines whether the conclusion is true or false. The phenomenon of hard cases is used to demonstrate this essential procedural nature of legal reasoning.

Dialogical Reason Based Logic offers a framework that makes it possible to model legal dialogues. We use Dialogical Reason Based Logic to specify hard cases in dialogical terms. Moreover, we analyse an actual Dutch hard case in terms of Dialogical Reason Based Logic, to demonstrate both the possibilities and the shortcomings of this approach.

It turns out that there is no one set of rational dialogue rules. There are many concurring sets of rules that govern particular types of dialogues. The rules for legal procedures are as much part of the law as the more substantial rules. As a consequence, it is not possible to offer an universal set of dialogue rules. Dialogical Reason Based Logic rather provides a framework which can be filled with dialogue rules that determine which dialogues are valid and which ones are invalid.

AB  - Ensuring compliance of software systems with government regulations, policies, and laws is a complex problem. Generally speaking, solutions to the problem first identify rights and obligations defined in the law and then treat these as requirements for the system under design. This work examines the challenge of developing tool support for extracting such requirements from legal documents. To address this challenge, we have developed a tool called GaiusT. The tool is founded on a framework for textual semantic annotation. It semiautomatically generates elements of requirements models, including actors, rights, and obligations. We present the complexities of annotating prescriptive text, the architecture of GaiusT, and the process by which annotation is accomplished. We also present experimental results from two case studies to illustrate the application of the tool and its effectiveness relative to manual efforts. The first case study is based on the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, while the second analyzes the Italian accessibility law for information technology instruments.

AB  - Eisner v. Macomber , 252 U.S. 189 (1920), a corporate tax case, was the principal illustration of a theory of legal reasoning and legal argumentation proposed more than ten years ago. Although the theory was described in some detail, using the vocabulary of prototypes and deformations, it was never fully implemented. There were two main problems: (1) the knowledge represen- tation languages available at the time were not suf- ciently expressive, and (2) as a result, the central concept of a prototype was never suciently formal- ized. These problems have been remedied by subse- quent work, and the present paper describes an im- plementation (in PROLOG) of the original theory. A study of the implemented system provides a rational reconstruction of the arguments of Justice Pitney and Justice Brandeis in this seminal corporate tax case.

AB  - We conducted an experiment to investigate whether a human tutor could employ the CATO model and instructional program to teach legal research and argumentation skills to beginning law stu&nts. The CATO model covem arguments comparing and contrasting casesin terms of factors, abstractionsof facts that tend to strengthen or weaken a party’s position on a legal claim. At the time of the experimen~ the CATO program comprised tools and resources that help apply the CATO model to specific problems, most importantly, a case database and tools for retrieving, displaying, and comparing casesin terms of factors. We compmed human-led itulruction with CATO against more traditional classroom instruction designed to teach the same skills, without the use of the CATO model or tools. The subjects were 17 fmtsemester students from the University of Pittsburgh Law School. We found that human-guided instruction with CATO was as good as classroom instruction, We also found that answers generated by the CATO program were scored higher than the students’ answers, suggestingthat the model can potentially be employed even more effectively to teach students. Examples drawn from protocols of CATO sessionsih.trate that students can use the CATO model to guide and facilitate the construction of arguments and often go beyond the model’s limitations, at least under the guidance of a human tutor.

AB  - Argumentation theory involves the analysis of naturally occurring argument, and one key tool employed to this end both in the academic community and in teaching critical thinking skills to undergraduates is argument diagramming. By identifying the structure of an argument in terms of its constituents and the relationships between them, it becomes easier to critically evaluate each part of an argument in turn. The task of analysis and diagramming, however, is labor intensive and often idiosyncratic, which can make academic exchange difficult. The Araucaria system provides an interface which supports the diagramming process, and then saves the result using AML, an open standard, designed in XML, for describing argument structure. Araucaria aims to be of use not only in pedagogical situations, but also in support of research activity. As a result, it has been designed from the outset to handle more advanced argumentation theoretic concepts such as schemes, which capture stereotypical patterns of reasoning. The software is also designed to be compatible with a number of applications under development, including dialogic interaction and online corpus provision. Together, these features, combined with its platform independence and ease of use, have the potential to make Araucaria a valuable resource for the academic community.

AB  - Work on a computer program called SMILE + IBP (SMart Index Learner Plus Issue-Based Prediction) bridges case-based reasoning and extracting information from texts. The program addresses a technologically challenging task that is also very relevant from a legal viewpoint: to extract information from textual descriptions of the facts of decided cases and apply that information to predict the outcomes of new cases. The program attempts to automatically classify textual descriptions of the facts of legal problems in terms of Factors, a set of classification concepts that capture stereotypical fact patterns that effect the strength of a legal claim, here trade secret misappropriation. Using these classifications, the program can evaluate and explain predictions about a problem's outcome given a database of previously classified cases. This paper provides an extended example illustrating both functions, prediction by IBP and text classification by SMILE, and reports empirical evaluations of each. While IBP's results are quite strong, and SMILE's much weaker, SMILE + IBP still has some success predicting and explaining the outcomes of case scenarios input as texts. It marks the first time to our knowledge that a program can reason automatically about legal case texts.

AB  - Carneades is a recently proposed formalism for structured argumentation with varying proof standards, inspired by legal reasoning, but more generally applicable. Its distinctive feature is that each statement can be given its own proof standard, which is claimed to allow a more natural account of reasoning under burden of proof than existing formalisms for structured argumentation, in which proof standards are defined globally. In this article, the two formalisms are formally related by translating Carneades into the ASPIC+ framework for structured argumentation. Since ASPIC+ is defined to generate Dung-style abstract argumentation frameworks, this in effect translates Carneades graphs into abstract argumentation frameworks. For this translation, we prove a formal correspondence and show that certain rationality postulates hold. It is furthermore proved that Carneades always induces a unique Dung extension, which is the same in all of Dung's semantics, allowing us to generalise Carneades to cycle-containi...

AB  - We present a computational model of dialectical argumentation that could serve as a basis for studying elements of legal reasoning. Argumentation is well-suited to decisionmaking in the legal domain, where knowledge is incomplete, uncertain, and inconsistent, We model an argument both as information structure, i.e., argument units connecting claims with supporting data, and as dialectical process, i.e., an alternating series of moves made by opposing sides. Inspired by the legal domain, our model includes burden of proof as a key element, indicating the level of support that must be achieved by a particular side to an argument. Burden of proof acts as a move filter and termination criterion during argumentation and determines the eventual winner. We demonstrate our model by considering two examples that have been discussed previously in the artificial intelligence and legal reasoning literature. INTRODUCTION As the artificial intelligence (AI) and legal reasoning communities are well aware, most decisions are reached against a background of incomplete, uncertain, and inconsistent knowledge (i.e., weak theory domains; Porter, et. al., 1990). The most widely used AI methods for reasoning under uncertainty either rely on an absence of outright contradictions (e. g., probabilistic reasoning; Pearl, 1987) or are unable to support motivated decision-making in the face of inconsistent information (e.g., default reasoning; Ginsberg, 1987). Both solutions put the problem of deciding what to believe outside their respective domains of discourse.

AB  - Normative texts can be viewed as composed by formal partitions (articles, paragraphs, etc.) or by semantic units containing fragments of a regulation (provisions). Provisions can be described according to a metadata scheme which consists of provision types and their arguments. This semantic annotation of a normative text can make the retrieval of norms easier. The detection and description of the provisions according to the established metadata scheme is an analytic intellectual activity aiming at classifying portions of a normative text into provision types and to extract their arguments. Automatic facilities supporting this intellectual activity are desirable. Particularly, in this paper, two modules able to qualify fragments of a normative text in terms of provision types and to extract their arguments are presented.

Drawing upon formal AI & Law models of legal argument a semi-formal reconstruction is given of parts of the Carney case, which has been studied previously in AI & law research on case-based reasoning. As part of the reconstruction, a semiformal proposal is made for extending the formal AI & Law models with forms of metalevel reasoning in several argument schemes. The result is compared with Rissland's (1989) analysis in terms of dimensions and Ashley's (2008) analysis in terms of his process model of legal argument with hypotheticals.

AB  - In 1993, Berman and Hafner criticized case-based models of legal reasoning for not modeling analogical and teleological elements. Another lesson learned since then is the role of ontologies in representing domain knowledge so that a legal reasoning system can represent and solve problems. If the reasoning involves drawing abstract analogies, reasoning teleologically about rules for deciding a case, and posing hypothetical cases to test decision rules, however, it is not clear what requirements the ontology should satisfy. This paper presents an extended example of such legal reasoning to illustrate what an ontology for case-based legal reasoning should provide. The example centers on a microworld of legal discourse, an ensemble of real legal cases, hypothetical examples, concepts, factors, principles and policies. Beginning with any case in the microworld, the system's goal is to generate arguments that a law professor and students might reasonably make in discussing the legal case in class. The example illustrates three roles the ontology should play in providing representational support for the system, distills the ontological requirements, and suggests an incremental approach to making good on Berman's and Hafner's challenge.

AB  - Most systems and business processes in organizations need to comply with more than one law or regulation. Different regulations can partially overlap (e.g., one can be more detailed than the other) or even conflict with each other. In addition, one regulation can permit an action whereas the same action in another regulation might be mandatory or forbidden. In each of these cases, an organization needs to take different strategies. This paper presents an approach to handle different situations when comparing and attempting to comply with multiple regulations as part of a goal-oriented modeling framework named LEGAL-URN. This framework helps organizations find suitable trade-offs and priorities when complying with multiple regulations while at the same time trying to meet their own business objectives. The approach is illustrated with a case study involving a Canadian health care organization that must comply with four laws related to privacy, quality of care, freedom of information, and care consent.

AB  - In this article, we introduce the application of rigorous analysis procedures to goal models to provide several benefits beyond the initial act of modeling. Such analysis can allow modelers to assess the satisfaction of goals, facilitate evaluation of high-level design alternatives, help analysts decide on the high-level requirements and design of the system, test the sanity of a model, and support communication and learning. The analysis of goal models can be done in very different ways depending on the nature of the model and the purpose of the analysis. In our work, we use the Goal-oriented Requirement Language (GRL), which is part of the User Requirements Notation (URN). URN, a new Recommendation of the International Telecommunications Union, provides the first standard goal-oriented language. Using GRL, we develop an approach to analysis that can be done by evaluating qualitative or quantitative satisfaction levels of the actors and intentional elements (e.g., goals and tasks) composing the model. Initial satisfaction levels for some of the intentional elements are provided in a strategy and then propagated to the other intentional elements of the model through the various links that connect them. The results allow for an assessment of the relative effectiveness of design alternatives at the requirements level. Although no specific propagation algorithm is imposed in the URN standard, different criteria for defining evaluation mechanisms are described. We provide three algorithms (quantitative, qualitative, and hybrid) as examples, which satisfy the constraints imposed by the standard. These algorithms have been implemented in the open-source jUCMNav tool, an Eclipse-based editor for URN models. The algorithms are presented and compared with the help of a telecommunication system example. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Government laws and organizational policies introduce critical legal requirements that govern information systems. Unlike traditional requirements elicited from stakeholders, legal requirements have unique characteristics that software engineers must address to ensure that their systems are demonstrably compliant with relevant laws and policies. This paper presents important terminology for developing legally compliant software systems and a methodology consisting of procedures and models for acquiring, representing and analyzing phenomena in legal documents, which constitute rich sources of legal requirements. Based on a grounded theory, the method has been validated through a mixed-methods approach consisting of multiple, descriptive case studies. This paper presents a human subject experiment that tests a fundamental part of the theory to understand the efficacy of multiple users applying the method to a sample regulation text.

Addressing law compliance in early phases of the requirements analysis helps in improving the alignment of information systems with the law. In this paper, we point out ontological differences between legal concepts and requirements and set the basis for a systematic process able to support decision making about requirements for law compliant systems.

AB  - In recent years several proposals to view reasoning with legal cases as theory construction have been advanced. The most detailed of these is that of Bench-Capon and Sartor, which uses facts, rules, values and preferences to build a theory designed to explain the decisions in a set of cases. In this paper we describe CATE (CAse Theory Editor), a tool intended to support the construction of theories as described by Bench-Capon and Sartor, and which produces executable code corresponding to a theory. CATE has been used in a series of experiments intended to explore a number of issues relating to such theories, including how the theories should be constructed, how sets of values should be compared, and the representation of cases using structured values as opposed to factors.

AB  - Semantic models have received little attention in recent years, much of their role having been taken over by developments in ontologies. Ontologies, however, are static, and so have only a limited role in reasoning about domains in which change matters. In this paper, we focus on the domain of policy deliberation, where policy decisions are designed to change things to realise particular social values. We explore how a particular kind of state transition system can be constructed to serve as a semantic model to support reasoning about alternative policy decisions. The policy making process includes stages that support the construction of a model, which can then be exploited in reasoning. The reasoning itself will be driven by a particular argumentation scheme for practical reasoning, and the ways in which arguments based on this scheme can be attacked and evaluated. The evaluation provides alternative policy positions. The semantics underpin a current web-based implementation, designed to solicit structured feedback on policy proposals.

AB  - Regulatory compliance management is now widely recognized as one of the main challenges still to be efficiently dealt with in information systems. In the discipline of business process management in particular, compliance is considered as an important driver of the efficiency, reliability and market value of companies. It consists of ensuring that enterprise systems behave according to some guidance provided in the form of regulations. This paper gives a definition of the research problem of regulatory compliance. We show why we expect a formal policy-based and model-driven approach to provide significant advantages in allowing enterprises to flexibly manage decision-making related to regulatory compliance. For this purpose, we contribute CoReL, a domain-specific modeling language for representing compliance requirements that has a graphical concrete syntax. Informal semantics of CoReL are introduced and its use is illustrated on an example. CoReL allows to leverage business process compliance modeling and checking, enhancing it with regard to, among other dimensions, user-friendliness, genericity, and traceability.

AB  - As many laws are concerned with information systems, each organization needs to carefully examine a law and determine technical requirements as well as its operational policies with sufficient concreteness. Legal interpretations essentially affect decisions made in refining goals, or making goals more concrete, that are directly or indirectly established by the law. As common and conventional interpretations are gradually identified and become widespread through appearances of cases and guidelines, goal refinement relationships need to be constantly managed and adjusted to the latest legal interpretations. This paper discusses an initial approach to management of legal interpretations together with goal-oriented requirements engineering, through a motivating example of a Japanese law on trade secrets. Specifically, this study proposes a metamodel for legal interpretation. In the metamodel, legal interpretations are modeled as refinement relationships between definitions of concepts or terms and then analyzed by matching with instances. Legal interpretations can then be woven into goal trees as criteria of goal refinement.

AB  - Companies that own, license, or maintain personal information face a daunting number of privacy and security regulations. Companies are subject to new regulations from one or more governing bodies, when companies introduce new or existing products into a jurisdiction, when regulations change, or when data are transferred across political borders. To address this problem, we developed a framework called "requirements water marking" that business analysts can use to align and reconcile requirements from multiple jurisdictions (municipalities, provinces, nations) to produce a single high or low standard of care. We evaluate the framework in two empirical case studies covering a subset of U.S. data breach notification laws and medical record retention laws. In these studies, applying our framework reduced the number of requirements a company must comply with by 76 % across 8 jurisdictions and 15 % across 4 jurisdictions, respectively. We show how the framework surfaces critical requirements trade-offs and potential regulatory conflicts that companies must address during the reconciliation process. We summarize our results, including surveys of information technology law experts to contextualize our empirical results in legal practice.

AB  - This paper takes up Berman and Hafner's (1993) challenge to model legal case-based reasoning not just in terms of factual similarities and differences but also in terms of the values that are at stake. The formal framework of Prakken and Sartor (1998) is applied to examples of case-based reasoning involving values, and a method for formalising such examples is proposed. The method makes it possible to express that a case should be decided in a certain way because that advances certain values. The method also supports the comparison of conflicting precedents in terms of values, and it supports debates on the relevance of distinctions in terms of values.

AB  - In this paper we consider persuasion in the context of practical reasoning, and discuss the problems associated with construing reasoning about actions in a manner similar to reasoning about beliefs. We propose a perspective on practical reasoning as presumptive justification of a course of action, along with critical questions of this justification, building on the account of Walton. From this perspective, we articulate an interaction protocol, which we call PARMA, for dialogues over proposed actions based on this theory. We outline an axiomatic semantics for the PARMA Protocol, and discuss two implementations which use this protocol to mediate a discussion between humans. We then show how our proposal can be made computational within the framework of agents based on the Belief-Desire-Intention model, and illustrate this proposal with an example debate within a multi agent system.

We motivate the style of argumentation supported by PADUA, and describe the protocol. We discuss the strategies and tactics that can be employed by agents participating in a PADUA dialogue. PADUA is applied to a typical problem in the classification of routine claims for a hypothetical welfare benefit. We particularly address the problems that arise from the extensive number of misclassified examples typically found in such domains, where the high error rate is a widely recognised problem. We give examples of the use of PADUA in this domain, and explore in particular the effect of intermediate predicates. We have also done a large scale evaluation designed to test the effectiveness of using PADUA to detect misclassified examples, and to provide a comparison with other classification systems.

AB  - Software requirements, rights, permissions, obligations, and operations of policy enforcing systems are often misaligned. Our goal is to develop tools and techniques that help requirements engineers and policy makers bring policies and system requirements into better alignment. Goals from requirements engineering are useful for distilling natural language policy statements into structured descriptions of these interactions; however, they are limited in that they are not easy to compare with one another despite sharing common semantic features. In this paper, we describe a process called semantic parameterization that we use to derive semantic models from goals mined from privacy policy documents. We present example semantic models that enable comparing policy statements and present a template method for generating natural language policy statements (and ultimately requirements) from unique semantic models. The semantic models are described by a context-free grammar called KTL that has been validated within the context of the most frequently expressed goals in over 100 Internet privacy policy documents. KTL is supported by a policy analysis tool that supports queries and policy statement generation.

AB  - Developing global markets offer companies new opportunities to manufacture and sell information technology (IT) products in ways unforeseen by current laws and regulations. This innovation leads to changing requirements due to changes in product features, laws, or the locality where the product is sold or manufactured. To help developers rationalize these changes, we introduce a preliminary framework and method that can be used by requirements engineers and their legal teams to identify relevant legal requirements and trace changes in requirements coverage. The framework includes a method to translate IT regulations into a legal requirements coverage model used to make coverage assertions about existing or planned IT systems. We evaluated the framework in a case study using three IT laws: California's Confidentiality of Medical Records Act, the U.S. Health Information Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and amendments from the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, and the India 2011 Information Technology Rules. Further, we demonstrate the framework using three scenarios: new product features are proposed; product-related services are outsourced abroad; and regulations change to address changes in the market.

AB  - Software engineers regularly build systems that are required to comply with laws and regulations. To this end, software engineers must determine which requirements have met or exceeded their legal obligations and which requirements have not. Requirements that have met or exceeded their legal obligations are legally implementation ready, whereas requirements that have not met or exceeded their legal obligations need further refinement. Research is needed to better understand how to support software engineers in making these determinations. In this paper, we describe a case study in which we asked graduate-level software engineering students to assess whether a set of software requirements for an electronic health record system met or exceeded their corresponding legal obligations as expressed in regulations created pursuant to the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). We compare the assessment made by graduate students with an assessment made by HIPAA compliance subject matter experts. Additionally, we contrast these results with those generated by a legal requirements triage algorithm. Our findings suggest that the average graduate-level software engineering student is ill-prepared to write legally compliant software with any confidence and that domain experts are an absolute necessity. Our findings also indicate the potential utility of legal requirements metrics in aiding software engineers as they make legal compliance decisions.

AB  - The high cost of non-compliance with laws and regulations that govern software systems makes legal requirements prioritization crucial. In addition, software design, expense, and time constraints all inuence how requirements are prioritized. Prioritizing requirements derived from laws and regulations can be untenable using traditional pairwise requirements prioritization techniques because the number of pairwise comparisons grows quadratically with the number of requirements. In this paper, we introduce legal requirements triage{{a technique used to subdivide a requirements set into three subsets: (a) implementation ready legal requirements; (b) legal requirements that require further renement; and (c) non-legal requirements. Legal requirements triage supplements a traditional pairwise requirements prioritization by focusing analysts on implementation ready legal requirements to reduce the number of pairwise comparisons. Herein, we discuss a case study in which we applied these techniques to prioritize 75 functional requirements for the iTrust Medical Records System, an open-source electronic health records system that must comply with the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Our study shows that we were able to reduce signicantly the number of pairwise comparisons.

AB  - In recent years it has become quite usual to view legal decisions in terms of consideration of the values affected by deciding the case for or against a particular party. Often deciding for, say, the plaintiff will promote one value at the expense of another. Precedents are then supposed to guide the way in which this conflict is resolved. In this paper we will consider a series of cases exploring the so-called automobile exception to the requirement of the Fourth Amendment protecting against unreasonable search of persons, houses, papers, and effects. These cases highlight a conflict between the value of law enforcement and the value of privacy as protected by the Fourth Amendment, and will be used to illuminate questions about the treatment of value conflicts arising from previous work in AI and Law.

AB  - In previous work we presented argumentation schemes to capture the CATO and value based theory construction approaches to reasoning with legal cases with factors. We formalised the schemes with ASPIC+, a formal representation of instantiated argumentation. In ASPIC+ the premises of a scheme may either be a factor provided in a knowledge base or established using a further argumentation scheme. Thus far we have taken the factors associated with cases to be given in the knowledge base. While this is adequate for expressing factor based reasoning, we can further investigate the justifications for the relationship between factors and facts or evidence. In this paper we examine how dimensions as used in the HYPO system can provide grounds on which to argue about which factors should apply to a case. By making this element of the reasoning explicit and subject to argument, we advance our overall account of reasoning with legal cases and make it more robust.

The paper contributes to the body of literature that formally analyses legal cases in terms of arguments and argument schemes. It is novel in that we analyse a case in a court of first instance, so we have arguments about facts, qualifications of intermediate predicates, and the application of legal rules. We show the importance of undercutters in relating principles to the specific case.

Our task is interpretation of under-defined terms that occur in legal statutes (like the Internal Revenue Code) where certain terms must be applied to particular cases even though their meanings are not defined by the statute and the statutory rules are unclear as to scope and meaning. We describe this problem, known as statutory interpretation, provide examples of it, describe the need for melding case-based and rule-based reasoning, and discuss heuristics used in guiding reasoning on such problems. We conclude with a discussion of our on-going work to model this mode of expert reasoning.

AB  - In modern societies, both business and private life are deeply pervaded by software and information systems.
Using software has extended human capabilities, allowing information to cross physical and ethical barriers.
To handle misuse dangers, governments are increasingly laying down new laws and introducing obligations, rights and responsibilities concerned with the use of software.
As a consequence, laws are assuming a steering role in the specification of software requirements, which must be compliant to avoid fines and penalties.

This work proposes a model-based approach to the problem of law compliance of software requirements. It aims at extending state-of-the-art goal-oriented requirements engineering techniques with the capability to argue about compliance, through the use and analysis of models. It is based on a language for modelling legal prescriptions. Upon the language, compliance can be defined as a condition that depends on a set of properties. Such a condition is achieved through an iterative modelling process.

Specifically, we investigated the nature of legal prescription to capture their conceptual language. From jurisprudence literature, we adopted a taxonomy of legal concepts, which has been elaborated and translated into a conceptual meta-model. Moreover, this metamodel was integrated with the meta-model of a goal-oriented modelling language for requirements engineering, in order to provide a common legal-intentional meta-model.

Requirements models built with the proposed language consist of graphs, which ultimately can be verified automatically. Compliance amounts then in a set of properties the graph must have.

The compliance condition gains relevance in two cases. Firstly, when a requirements model has already been developed, and it needs to be reconciled with a set of laws. Secondly, when requirements have to be modelled from scratch, and they are need to be compliant. In both cases, compliance results from a design process.

The proposed modelling language, as well as the compliance condition and the corresponding design process, have been applied to two case studies.
The obtained results confirm the validity of the approach, and point out interesting research directions for the future.

AB  - After a period of little regulation, many companies are now facing a growing number and an increasing complexity of new laws, regulations, and standards. This has a huge impact on how organizations conduct their daily business and involves various changes in organizational and governance structures, software systems and data flows as well as corporate culture, organizational power and communication. We argue that the implementation of a holistic compliance cannot be divided into isolated projects, but instead requires a thorough analysis of relevant components as well as an integrated design of the very same. This paper examines the state-of-the-art of compliance research in the field of information systems (IS) by means of a comprehensive literature analysis. For the systemization of our results we apply a holistic framework for enterprise analysis and design. The framework allows us to both point out “focus areas” as well as “less travelled roads” and derive a future research agenda for compliance research.

These frameworks adopt the same machinery and level of abstraction as Dung's argumentation framework. We thus provide a dialectical argumentation semantics that integrates accrual, and illustrate our approach by instantiating our framework with the arguments and attacks defined by an object level formalism that accommodates reasoning about priorities over sets of rules.

AB  - Information systems are increasingly distributed and pervasive, enabling organizations to deliver remote services and share personal information, worldwide. However, developers face significant challenges in managing the many laws that govern their systems in this multi-jurisdictional environment. In this paper, we report on a computational requirements document expressible using a legal requirements specification language (LRSL). The purpose is to make legal requirements open and available to policy makers, business analysts and software developers, alike. We show how requirements engineers can codify policy and law using the LRSL and design, debug, analyze, trace, and visualize relationships among regulatory requirements. The LRSL provides new constructs for expressing distributed constraints, making regulatory specification patterns visually salient, and enabling metrics to quantitatively measure different styles for writing legal and policy documents. We discovered and validated the LRSL using thirteen U.S. state data breach notification laws.

AB  - Regulated companies are required to comply with the laws and regulations that apply to their industries. An important aspect of these authoritative rules is directly related to the way by which software systems, used by the regulated companies, are built, tested, and maintained. As a result, many regulated companies have turned to their software vendors to request their support in the compliance efforts. For most global software vendors, this new situation represents a significant challenge. From the technological standpoint, the complexity and sheer volume of typical authoritative rules poses a serious obstacle to implementing effective compliance support strategies. From the organizational perspective, the delivery of compliance support activities requires efficient business processes, skilled and valued employees, and a strong governance model with commitment at all management levels. To address these issues, we present a compliance support framework that aims to facilitate the linkage between compliance requirements, software development practices, and business process management. We believe that, if implemented properly, this framework can significantly improve the way software companies handle the increasing customer demand for compliance support. It can turn compliance support into a revenue-generating activity, and possibly a competitive advantage.

In this paper we argue that existing tools exhibit a number of limitations, and that these can be addressed by basing tools on developments in the field of computational argumentation. After discussing the limitations, we present an argumentation scheme which can be used to justify policy proposals, and a way of modelling the domain so that arguments using this scheme and attacks upon them can be automatically generated. We then present two prototype tools: one to present justifications and receive criticism, and the other to elicit justifications of user-proposed policies and critique them. We use a running example of a genuine policy debate to illustrate the various aspects.

AB  - This paper provide a structured analysis of US Supreme Court Oral Hearings to enable identification of the relevant issues, factors and facts that can be used to construct a test to resolve a case. Our analysis involves the production of what we term ‘argument component trees’ (ACTs) in which the issues, facts and factors, and the relationship between these, are made explicit. We show how such ACTs can be constructed by identifying the speech acts that are used by the counsel and Justices within their dialogue. We illustrate the application of our analysis by applying it to the oral hearing for the case of Carney v. California, and we relate the majority and minority opinions delivered in that case to our ACTs. The aim of the work is to provide a formal framework that addresses a particular aspect of case-based reasoning: enabling the identification and representation of the components that are used to form a test to resolve a case and guide future behaviour.

AB  - In the last decade, statutory interpretation has reemerged as an important topic of academic theory and discussion.' This development is welcome, since few topics are more relevant to legal craft and education than the interpretation of statutes, now our primary source of law. The recent theoretical views, however, contrast with practicing lawyers' strategies of statutory interpretation. When practitioners give advice to clients about what a statute means, their approach is usually eclectic: They look at the text of the relevant statutory provisions, any legislative history that is available, the context in which the legislation was enacted, the overall legal landscape, and the lessons of common sense and good policy. But when law professors talk about statutory interpretation, they tend to posit a more abstract, "grand" theory that privileges one or another of these approaches as "foundational."2 The commentators' grand theories contrast with the more ad hoc, factbased reasoning of the practicing lawyer. How do judges interpret statutes? How should they? Many commentators argue that judicial interpretation is, or at least ought to be, inspired by grand theory. We think these commentators are wrong, both descriptively and normatively: Judges' approaches to statutory interpretation are generally eclectic, not inspired by any grand theory,

A metamodel is defined for our framework to define compliance tracking links between separate User Requirements Notation models of the HIC and privacy legislation.

AB  - The construction of arguments has long been viewed as a paradigmatic example of human reasoning and, as such, is an important ability for computer programs that attempt to model intelligent behavior. We explore the use of argumentation for deriving and justifying claims in domains where knowledge is incomplete, uncertain, or inconsistent, i.e., weak theory domains. Argumentation supports a notion of proof appropriate for reasoning in weak theory domains, e.g., a claim is proved if there is plausible, irrefutable support for the claim, and there is no such support for any counter-claim.
We present elements of a theory of argumentation involving two senses of argument, argument as supporting explanation and argument as dialectical process. For argument as supporting explanation, we create argument structures that organize relevant, available support for both a claim and its negation. In dialectical argument, the format of a two-sided argument process is used to intertwine the strengths and weaknesses of support for competing claims, so arguments can be refuted and directly compared. Our account of dialectical argumentation includes a catalog of argument moves and a set of heuristics for selecting moves and thereby controlling argument generation.
This model, which has been implemented in a computer program, is a flexible environment for exploring the representation and generation of arguments. We show how the program generates reasonable arguments for a set of example problems. We give an analysis of the program, including limits of the current model of argumentation.
For artificial intelligence programs, the ability to generate arguments provides a useful technique for reasoning in real world contexts. For argumentation researchers, artificial intelligence methodology offers a new way for evaluating theories of argumentation.

The proof theories have the form of argument games for testing membership of some (credulous reasoning) or all preferred extensions (sceptical reasoning). The credulous proof theory is for the general case, while the sceptical version is for the case where preferred semantics coincides with stable semantics. The development of these argument games is especially motivated by applications of argumentation in automated negotiation, mediation of collective discussion and decision making, and intelligent tutoring.

As software systems become increasingly large and complex, the need increases to predict and control the effects of software changes. Software Change Impact Analysis captures the latest information on the science and art of determining what software parts affect each other. It provides a battery of ideas for doing impact analysis better, presents a framework for the field, and focuses attention on important results. You will gain a healthy respect for the strengths and limitations of impact analysis technology and a solid background that will prove valuable for years to come. The book identifies key impact analysis definitions and themes and illustrates the important themes to give you a solid understanding for tackling impact analysis problems. It includes reports on software source code dependency analysis and software traceability analysis and shows how results from both areas can more effectively support impact analysis in software engineering repositories. It also describes why impact representation and determination techniques are at the heart of both source dependency analysis and traceability analysis.

AB  - Business process design is primarily driven by process improvementobjectives. However, the role of control objectives stemming from regulationsand standards is becoming increasingly important for businesses in light ofrecent events that led to some of the largest scandals in corporate history. Asorganizations strive to meet compliance agendas, there is an evident need toprovide systematic approaches that assist in the understanding of the interplaybetween (often conflicting) business and control objectives during businessprocess design. In this paper, our objective is twofold. We will firstly present aresearch agenda in the space of business process compliance, identifying majortechnical and organizational challenges. We then tackle a part of the overallproblem space, which deals with the effective modeling of control objectivesand subsequently their propagation onto business process models. Controlobjective modeling is proposed through a specialized modal logic based onnormative systems theory, and the visualization of control objectives onbusiness process models is achieved procedurally. The proposed approach isdemonstrated in the context of a purchase-to-pay scenario.

The process model has been partially implemented in the LARGO (Legal ARgument Graph Observer) intelligent tutoring system. The program supports students in diagramming oral argument examples; its feedback on students' diagrammatic reconstructions of the examples enforces the expectations of the process model. The paper presents empirical evidence that features of the argument diagrams made with LARGO are correlated with independent measures of argumentation ability. The examples and empirical results support the model's explanatory and diagnostic utility.

AB  - In this article we evaluate the BankXX program from several perspectives. BankXX is a case-based legal argument program that retrieves cases and other legal knowledge pertinent to a legal argument through a combination of heuristic search and knowledge-based indexing. The program is described in detail in a companion article in (this issue of) the Journal of Artificial Intelligence and Law. Three perspectives are used to evaluate BankXX: (1) classical information retrieval measures of precision and recall applied against a hand-coded baseline; (2) knowledge- representation and case-based reasoning perspectives, where the baseline is provided by the functionality of a well-known case-based argument program, HYPO [Ashley, 1990]; and (3) search perspective, in which the performance of BankXX run with various parameter settings, for instance, resource limits, is compared. In this article we report on an extensive series of experiments performed to evaluate the program. We also describe two brief experiments on ancillary questions regarding the program''s search behavior and knowledge representation. Finally we offer some general conclusions that might be drawn from these particular experiments.

AB  - Compliance of business processes with authoritative rules is significantly important to avoid financial penalties, efficiency problems, and reputation damages. However, finding the right measures to evaluate and track compliance is very challenging. We propose a novel method to model the context and measure compliance using the User Requirements Notation (URN). We mainly use Key Performance Indicator (KPI) extensions of URN to measure the level of compliance to rules. Such KPIs have been used in the past to measure the satisfaction level of goals and the performance of business processes. Yet, they have never been used for measuring compliance. Our method highlights the non-compliant policies and rules on a quadrant map based on their importance and compliance levels. Furthermore, we suggest a new method for importance calculation in this context. We use a human resource policy example to illustrate our method.

This Legal Knowledge Interchange Format, is under development in the Estrella project and has two main roles: 1) the translation of legal knowledge bases written in different representation formats and formalisms and 2) a knowledge representation formalism that is part of a larger architecture for developing legal knowledge systems. A legal (core) ontology can play an important role in the translation of existing legal knowledge bases to other representation formats, in particular into LKIF as the basis for articulate knowledge serving. We describe the methodology underlying the LKIF core ontology, introduce the concepts it defines, and discuss its use in the formalisation of an EU directive.

AB  - From the Publisher:
In his groundbreaking new book, John Pollock establishes an outpost at the crossroads where artificial intelligence meets philosophy. Specifically, he proposes a general theory of rationality and then describes its implementation in OSCAR, an architecture for an autonomous rational agent he claims is the "first AI system capable of performing reasoning that philosophers would regard as epistemically sophisticated."
A sequel to Pollock's How to Build a Person, this volume builds upon that theoretical groundwork for the implementation of rationality through artificial intelligence. Pollock argues that progress in AI has stalled because of its creators' reliance upon unformulated intuitions about rationality. Instead, he bases the OSCAR architecture upon an explicit philosophical theory of rationality, encompassing principles of practical cognition, epistemic cognition, and defeasible reasoning. One of the results is the world's first automated defeasible reasoner capable of reasoning in a rich, logical environment.
Underlying Pollock's thesis is a conviction that the tenets of artifical intelligence and those of philosophy can be complementary and mutually beneficial. And, while members of both camps have in recent years grown skeptical of the very possibility of "symbol processing" AI, Cognitive Carpentry establishes that such an approach to AI can be successful.

AB  - Argumentation is a promising model for reasoning with uncertain and inconsistent knowledge. The key concept of acceptability enables to differentiate arguments and defeaters: The certainty of a proposition can then be evaluated through the most acceptable arguments for that proposition. In this paper, we investigate different complementary points of view: an acceptability based on the existence of direct defeaters and an acceptability based on the existence of defenders. Pursuing previous work on preference-based argumentation principles, we enforce both points of view by taking into account preference orderings for comparing arguments. Our approach is illustrated in the context of reasoning with stratified knowledge bases.

AB  - Growth in electronic commerce has enabled businesses to reduce costs and expand markets by deploying information technology through new and existing business practices. However, government laws and regulations require businesses to employ reasonable security measures to thwart risks associated with this technology. Because many security vulnerabilities are only discovered after attacker exploitation, regulators update their interpretation of reasonable security to stay current with emerging threats. With a focus on determining what businesses must do to comply with these changing interpretations of the law, we conducted an empirical, multi-case study to discover and measure the meaning and evolution of ''reasonable'' security by examining 19 regulatory enforcement actions by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) over a 10 year period. The results reveal trends in FTC enforcement actions that are institutionalizing security knowledge as evidenced by 39 security requirements that mitigate 110 legal security vulnerabilities.

AB  - The performance modeling of regulations is a relatively recent innovation. However, as regulators in many domains increasingly look to move from prescriptive regulations towards more outcome-based regulations, the use of performance modeling will become more common place. The major difference of outcome-based regulations over prescriptive regulations is that the main interest lies in specifying clear objectives of the regulations and measuring whether regulated parties achieve these objectives, while leaving much freedom to the regulated party on how to meet these objectives. Recently, we have found that the use of performance modeling provides benefits such as revealing inconsistencies and lack of clarity in existing regulatory language. In this paper, we report on these experiences, summarize guidelines for the modeling of regulations, and examine whether the current drafting processes for regulations are optimized to take advantage of these additional benefits. We explore the advantages and disadvantages of various ways of augmenting the current approach with goal-oriented modeling of regulations. Based on our experience with Aviation Security regulations, we believe it is time for modeling to play a new role in helping to guide the drafting of regulations.

PY  - 2009
AB  - The abstract nature of Dung's seminal theory of argumentation accounts for its widespread application as a general framework for various species of non-monotonic reasoning, and, more generally, reasoning in the presence of conflict. A Dung argumentation framework is instantiated by arguments and a binary conflict based attack relation, defined by some underlying logical theory. The justified arguments under different extensional semantics are then evaluated, and the claims of these arguments define the inferences of the underlying theory. To determine a unique set of justified arguments often requires a preference relation on arguments to determine the success of attacks between arguments. However, preference information is often itself defeasible, conflicting and so subject to argumentation. Hence, in this paper we extend Dung's theory to accommodate arguments that claim preferences between other arguments, thus incorporating meta-level argumentation based reasoning about preferences in the object level. We then define and study application of the full range of Dung's extensional semantics to the extended framework, and study special classes of the extended framework. The extended theory preserves the abstract nature of Dung's approach, thus aiming at a general framework for non-monotonic formalisms that accommodate defeasible reasoning about as well as with preference information. We illustrate by formalising argument based logic programming with defeasible priorities in the extended theory.

AB  - This paper presents a partial theory of arguing with precedents in law and illustrates how that theory supports multiple interpretations of a precedent. The theory provides succinct computational definitions of (1) the most persuasive precedents to cite in the principal argument roles and (2) the most salient aspects of the precedents to emphasize when citing them in those roles. An extended example, drawn from the output of the HYPO program, illustrates the range of different descriptions of the same precedent that are supported by the theory. Each description focuses on different salient aspects of the case depending on the argument context.

The account provided here has the additional advantage of showing how this reason model can be reconciled with the traditional idea that precedential constraint involves rules, as long as these rules are taken to be defeasible. The account presented is firmly based on a body of work that has emerged in AI and Law. This work is discussed, and there is a particular discussion of approaches based on theory construction, and how that work relates to the model described in this paper.

I first consider their method of representing cases, and describe how — if we restrict ourselves to independent boolean factors — we can fruitfully model the domain as a partial order on rules. I then consider the issues relating to quantifiable factors, as used in HYPO, and factor hierarchies, as used in CATO. The former presents some difficulties for modelling as a partial order, and, coupled with the latter, forces us to recognise two different kinds of reasoning used in concept application which have different implications for representing the domain. I then present some conclusions arising from the discussion.

As such it is important both that arguments are considered in the context of competing, attacking and supporting arguments, and that the possibility of rational disagreement is accommodated. We present two formal frameworks for considering systems of arguments: the standard framework of Dung, and an extension which relates arguments to values allowing for rational disagreement. We apply these frameworks to modelling a body of case law, explain how the frameworks can be generated to reconstruct legal reasoning in particular cases, and describe some tools to support the extraction of the value related knowledge required from a set of precedent cases.

We have previously proposed a method by which explanations can be improved by making use of annotations on program clauses as to the role of the clause, and organising the explanation according to an argument schema based on that of Stephen Toulmin. In this paper we describe an application of this approach to a part of the British Nationality Act. This serves to illustrate both the practicality of making the required annotations on a legal logic program, and the gains in terms of explanation that can be achieved.

AB  - In the service industry, such as healthcare, catering, tourism, and others, there exist regulations that require organisations to provide service outcomes that comply with the regulations. More and more regulations in the service sector are, or are aimed to be, outcome-focused regulations. An outcome prescribed in the regulation is what users should experience or achieve when the regulated business processes are compliant. Service providers need to proactively ensure that the outcomes specified in the regulations have been achieved prior to conducting the relevant part of the business or prior to inspectors discovering noncompliance. Published approaches check requirements or business processes, not outcomes, against regulations and thus this still leaves uncertain as to whether what the users actually experience is what is prescribed in the regulations. In this research preview paper., we propose a method for assessing the compliance of process outcomes. Actual outcomes from business processes are checked against prescribed outcomes from the regulations. The method is illustrated by an example from the U.K.'s CQC regulations in the care-home environment. The key contribution of this paper is a preliminary approach for proactively checking the compliance of process outcomes.

AB  - This paper presents an argument-based logic for reasoning about allocations of the burden of persuasion. The logic extends the system of Prakken (2001), which in turn modified the system of Prakken & Sartor (1996) with the possibility to distribute the burden of proof over both sides in an argument game. First the (2001) system is put in the context of a distinction of three types of proof burdens and it is argued that the proof burdens of that system are in fact burdens of persuasion. Then the (2001) system is modified to allow for defeasible reasoning about allocations of such burdens within the logic. The usefulness of the resulting system is illustrated with applications to real legal cases.

AB  - In this paper we describe a system, called BankXX, which generates arguments by performing a heuristic best-first search of a highly interconnected network of legal knowledge. The legal knowledge includes cases represented from a variety of points of view—cases as collections of facts, cases as dimensionally-analyzed fact situations, cases as bundles of citations, and cases as prototypical factual scripts—as well as legal theories represented in terms of domain factors. BankXX performs its search for useful information using one of three evaluation functions encoded at different levels of abstraction: the domain level, an “argument-piece” level, and the overall argument level. Evaluation at the domain level uses easily accessible information about the nodes,  such  as their type; evaluation at the argument-piece level uses information about generally useful components of case-based argument, such as best cases and supporting legal theories; evaluation at the overall-argument level uses factors, called argument dimensions, which address the overall substance and quality of an argument, such as the centrality of its supporting cases or the success record of its best theory. BankXX is instantiated in the area of personal bankruptcy governed by Chapter 13 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which permits a debtor to be discharged from debts through completion of a court-approved payment plan. In particular, our system addresses the requirement that such Chapter 13 plans be “proposed in good faith.”

AB  - The first part of the paper suggests that knowledge base systems can be viewed simply as a means of changing the medium in which legislation is presented to administrative decision-makers for their consideration. When viewed as a delivery vehicle for a body of rules, rather than as a reasoning decision-making tool, knowledge base systems which reliably model legislation offer major benefits in the administration of complex legislation.

AB  - Extracting essential meaning from the regulatory text helps in the automation of the Compliance Management (CM) process. CM is a process where organizations assure that the processes are run according to requirements and expectations. However, extraction of meaningful text from regulatory guidelines comes with many research challenges such as dealing with different document-format, implicit document-structure, textual ambiguity and complexity. In this paper, the extended version of the Semantic-ART framework is described, which focuses on tackling the challenges of document-structure identification and regulatory-entity extraction. An initial result has shown an inspirational result as compared to the previous version of the framework.

AB  - Governments and other groups interested in the views of citizens require the means to present justifications of proposed actions, and the means to solicit public opinion concerning these justifications. Although Internet technologies provide the means for such dialogues, system designers usually face a choice between allowing unstructured dialogues, through, for example, bulletin boards, or requiring citizens to acquire a knowledge of some argumentation schema or theory, as in, for example, ZENO. Both of these options present usability problems. In this paper, we describe an implemented system called PARMENIDES which allows structured argument over a proposed course of action, without requiring knowledge of the underlying argumentation theory.

AB  - This paper reports on the mid-beta stage of development of the Flexicon system and descrii how a 1exicaUy designed search engine in a domain specific database such as a large database of legal cases, can provide better relevance ranking than best match search engines, and at the same time permit an information need to be formulated using multiple word concepts, phrases and items, which is the one great advantage that an exact match Boolean search engine has to offer over best match engines. In addition the paper sets out in detail the lexical structure of the Flexicon system. The first tests on a legal problem, comparing the Flexicon system with two best match systems, indicate that a lexkally designed search engine and database has the potential for a substantially higher level of precision than best match search engines.

AB  - CAT0 is an intelligent learning environment designed to help &@ting law students learn basic skills of making arguments with cases, through practice in theory-testing and argumentation tasks. CAT0 models ways in which experts compare and contrast cases, assess the significance of similarities and differences between cases in light of general domain knowledge, and use the same general knowledge to organize multi-case arguments by issues. CAT0 communicates its model to students by presenting dynamically-generated argumentation examples and reifying (i.e., making visible) argument structure. Also, the CAT0 Tools reduce some of the distracting complexity of the students’ task. gal education seeks to teach. But they are difficult to learn and time-consuming to teach. If computer-based instruction can help students get some extra practice in basic skills and free up instructor’s time for more advanced topics, much would be gained. We evaluated CAT0 in the context of a second-semester Iegal writing course taught at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law. We found that 7.5 hours of CAT0 instruction led to a statistically significant improvement in students’ basic argumentation skills, comparable to that achieved, in the same amount of time, by an experienced legal writing instructor teaching small groups of students in a more traditional way. On a more advanced memo-writing assignment, meant to explore the “frontier” of the CAT0 instruction, students taught by the legal writing instructor did better, indicating that more is needed if CAT0 is to help students to improve their memo-writing skills. CAT0 employs a computational model of case-based argumentation that addresses eight basic argument moves and more elaborate multi-case arguments. The model includes a “Factor Hierarchy,” which represents more nbstract., but still domain-specific, legal knowledge about the meaning of the factors used to represent cases. CAT0 uses the Factor Hierarchy for a number of purposes, among them to organize multi-case arguments by issues and to make arguments about the significance of distinctions. To generate the latter, CAT0 strategically selects alternative interpretations of cases to elaborate a “deeper” (or more. abstract) contrast or parallel between cases.

DO  - 
PY  - 1961
AB  - The Concept of Law is the most important and original work of legal philosophy written this century. First published in 1961, it is considered the masterpiece of H.L.A. Hart's enormous contribution to the study of jurisprudence and legal philosophy. Its elegant language and balanced arguments have sparked wide debate and unprecedented growth in the quantity and quality of scholarship in this area--much of it devoted to attacking or defending Hart's theories. Principal among Hart's critics is renowned lawyer and political philosopher Ronald Dworkin who in the 1970s and 80s mounted a series of challenges to Hart's Concept of Law. It seemed that Hart let these challenges go unanswered until, after his death in 1992, his answer to Dworkin's criticism was discovered among his papers. In this valuable and long-awaited new edition Hart presents an Epilogue in which he answers Dworkin and some of his other most influential critics including Fuller and Finnis. Written with the same clarity and candor for which the first edition is famous, the Epilogue offers a sharper interpretation of Hart's own views, rebuffs the arguments of critics like Dworkin, and powerfully asserts that they have based their criticisms on a faulty understanding of Hart's work. Hart demonstrates that Dworkin's views are in fact strikingly similar to his own. In a final analysis, Hart's response leaves Dworkin's criticisms considerably weakened and his positions largely in question. Containing Hart's final and powerful response to Dworkin in addition to the revised text of the original Concept of Law, this thought-provoking and persuasively argued volume is essential reading for lawyers and philosophers throughout the world.

AB  - The huge text archives and retrieval systems of legal information have not achieved yet the representation in the well-known subject-oriented structure of legal commentaries. Content-based classification and text analysis remains a high priority research topic. In the joint KONTERM, SOM and LabelSOM projects, learning techniques of neural networks are used to achieve similar high compression rates of classification and analysis like in manual legal indexing. The produced maps of legal text corpora cluster related documents in units that are described with automatically selected descriptors. Extensive tests with text corpora in European case law have shown the feasibility of this approach. Classification and labeling proved very helpful for legal research. The Growing Hierarchical Self-Organizing Map represents very interesting generalities and specialties of legal text corpora. The segmentation into document parts improved very much the quality of labeling. The next challenge would be a change from tf × idf vector representation to a modified vector representation taking into account thesauri or ontologies considering learned properties of legal text corpora.

AB  - Oblog-2 is a hybrid knowledge representation system comparable to Krypton and KL-TWO. It combines a terminological reasoner with a Prolog-like inference mechanism. The terminological component supports the description of type and attribute taxonomies. Entities are instances of a set of types. Procedures for determining the values of attributes are Horn clause rules indexed by type. The known types of an entity determine its set of applicable rules, which changes as our knowledge about the types of the entity is refined, supporting a form of defeasible reasoning. Oblog-2 has been designed for modeling legal domains. Laws can be represented as general rules with exceptions, a technique traditionally used in the law, together with burden of proof rules, for reaching decisions when less than perfect information is available.

AB  - In this paper we revisit reasoning with legal cases, with a view to articulating the relationships between issues, factors, facts and values, and to identifying areas for future work on these topics. We start from the different ways in which attempts have been made to go beyond a fortori reasoning from the precedent base, so that conclusions not fully justified by the precedents can be drawn. We then use a particular example domain taken from the literature to illustrate our preferred approach and to relate factors and values. From this we observe that much current work depends critically on the ascription of factors to cases in a Boolean manner, while in practice there are compelling reasons to see the presence of factors as a matter of degree. On the basis of our observations we make suggestions for the directions of future work on this topic.

AB  - In this paper, we describe exploratory experiments for detecting potential "Gray Cygnet" cases that follow a known Black Swan. Gray Cygnets (GCs) are cases that are highly similar and subsequent to novel, surprising, provocative, exceptional cases, so-called Black Swans. They too are surprising, exceptional and provocative in the sense of continuing the change initiated by the Black Swan. Our experiments were carried out using a corpus of common law cases from the United States, particularly New York and Massachusetts, and the United Kingdom primarily in the era 1852-1916 during which there was dramatic change in the prevailing doctrine regarding recovery for damages by a remote buyer. It was provoked by the 1852 landmark case Thomas & Wife v. Winchester and elaborated in subsequent cases. Our methods use similarity measures from Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) based on classic claim lattice and nearest neighbor techniques. We also define and use "supreme on-point cases" (sopc's) that reside in the root node of a claim lattice. We define four simple tests to determine whether a problem case is a potential Gray Cygnet. The tests use the position of a known Black Swan in the analysis of a problem case, specifically whether it appears as a sopc, or mopc, and/or as a nearest neighbor. We also use the tests as an ensemble by using the decision of their majority vote. To evaluate the performance of our tests, we created an answer key based on a closed form definition of a GC in our domain.

AB  - This paper addresses the problem of regulation consistency checking. Regulations are sets of rules which express what is obligatory, permitted, forbidden and under which conditions. We first define a first order language to model regulations. Then we introduce a definition of regulation consistency. We show that checking the consistency of a regulation comes to generate some particular consequences of some first order formulas. Then, we show that we can apply Inoue's inference rule, SOL-resolution, which is complete for generating, from some clauses, their consequences which satisfy a given condition.

AB  - Conceptual retrieval requires the computer to have knowledge of legal concepts and issues, and their relationship to the case law collection. This paper discusses the organization of a case law knowledge base in terms of three interacting components: a  domain knowledge model  defines the basic concepts of a case law domain;  individual case descriptors  describe the particular constellation of concepts that pertain to each case, organized into a frame-based superstructure according to the legal roles they fill; and  issue/case discrimination trees  represent the significance of each case relative to a model of the normative relationships of the legal domain. Each of these components is described and justified by showing its contribution to the goal of conceptual retrieval.

AB  - This paper proposes a model ofratio decidendi as a justification structure consisting of a series of reasoning steps, some of which relate abstract predicates to other abstract predicates and some of which relate abstract predicates to specific facts. This model satisfies an important set of characteristics ofratio decidendi identified from the jurisprudential literature. In particular, the model shows how the theory under which a case is decided controls its precedential effect. By contrast, a purely exemplar-based model ofratio decidendi fails to account for the dependency of precedential effect on the theory of decision.

AB  - This paper discusses some engineering considerations that should be taken into account when building a knowledge based system, and recommends isomorphism, the well defined correspondence of the knowledge base to the source texts, as a basic principle of system construction in the legal domain. Isomorphism, as it has been used in the field of legal knowledge based systems, is characterised and the benefits which stem from its use are described. Some objections to and limitations of the approach are discussed. The paper concludes with a case study giving a detailed example of the use of the isomorphic approach in a particular application.

AB  - In this paper we discuss a hybrid approach to the problem of statutory interpretation that involves combining our past approach to case-based reasoning (“CBA”), as exemplified in our previous HYPO and TAX-HYPO systems, with traditional rule-based reasoning (“RBR”), as exemplified by expert systems. We do not tackle the fullblown version of statutory interpretation, which would include reasoning with legislative intent or other normative aspects (the “ought”), but confine ourselves to reasoning with explicit cases and rules. We discuss strategies that can be used to guide interpretation, particularly the interleaving of CBR and RBR, and how they are used in an agenda-based architecture, called CABARET, which we are currently developing in a general way and experimenting with in the particular area of Section §280A(c)(1) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, which deals with the so called “home office deduction”.

AB  - The paper gives ontologies in the Web Ontology Language (OWL) for Legal Case-based Reasoning (LCBR) systems, giving explicit, formal, and general specifications of a conceptualisation LCBR. Ontologies for different systems allows comparison and contrast between them. OWL Ontologies are standardised, machine-readable formats that support automated processing with Semantic Web applications. Intermediate concepts, concepts between base-level concepts and higher level concepts, are central in LCBR. The main issues and their relevance to ontological reasoning and to LCBR are discussed. Two LCBR systems (AS-CATO, which is based on CATO, and IBP) are analysed in terms of basic and intermediate concepts. Central components of the OWL ontologies for these systems are presented, pointing out differences and similarities. The main novelty of the paper is the ontological analysis and representation in OWL of LCBR systems. The paper also emphasises the important issues concerning the representation and reasoning of intermediate concepts.

AB  - Online policy documents—such as privacy policies, notices of privacy practices, and terms of use—describe organizations’ information practices for collecting, storing, and using consumers’ personal information. Organizations need to ensure that the commitments they express in their policy documents reflect their actual business practices. This compliance is significant in the United States where the Federal Trade Commission regulates fair business practices. Therefore, the requirements engineers developing systems for organizations need to understand the policy documents in order to know the information practices with which the software must comply. The requirements engineers also must ensure that the commitments expressed in these policy documents are incorporated into the software requirements. In this paper, we present a summative case study of a commitment analysis approach. The approach was developed during a formative case study of four healthcare organizations’ policy documents. Within this approach, we obtain requirements from policy documents based on our theory of commitments, privileges, and rights. During our summative case study we applied our commitment analysis approach to eight healthcare organizations’ policy documents in order to validate the methodology. We discuss the results of the summative study, in which we found that most of the statements express organizational practices or procedures. The top seen classification conveys pledges made by the organization based on organizational practices. The second most seen classification expresses actions that the user is entitled to perform based on organizational practices.

AB  - ABSTRACT Inspired by legal reasoning, this paper presents a semantics and proof theory of a system for defeasible argumentation. Arguments are expressed in a logic-programming language with both weak and strong negation, conflicts between arguments are decided with the help of priorities on the rules. An important feature of the system is that these priorities are not fixed, but are themselves defeasibly derived as conclusions within the system. Thus debates on the choice between conflicting arguments can also be modelled. The semantics of the system is given with a fixpoint definition, while its proof theory is stated in dialectical style, where a proof takes the form of a dialogue between a proponent and an opponent of an argument: an argument is shown to be justified if the proponent can make the opponent run out of moves in whatever way the opponent attacks.

AB  - Logic programming has been applied to a variety of examples in law and rules and regulations of different kinds. The best known examples are the representations of the British Nationality Act 1981 [Sergot et al. 1986] and United Kingdom social security legislation [Bench-Capon et al. 1987] constructed at Imperial College, London. The paper [Sergot 1988] and the survey [Sergot 1990] contain references to other applications. Essentially, these applications construct a legal analysis program by representing some fragment of legislation in logic and then executing the representatio~ either as a stand-alone program or as a compment of some bigger system.

AB  - Businesses and organizations in jurisdictions around the world are required by law to provide their customers and users with information about their business practices in the form of policy documents. Requirements engineers analyze these documents as sources of requirements, but this analysis is a time-consuming and mostly manual process. Moreover, policy documents contain legalese and present readability challenges to requirements engineers seeking to analyze them. In this paper, we perform a large-scale analysis of 2,061 policy documents, including policy documents from the Google Top 1000 most visited websites and the Fortune 500 companies, for three purposes: (1) to assess the readability of these policy documents for requirements engineers; (2) to determine if automated text mining can indicate whether a policy document contains requirements expressed as either privacy protections or vulnerabilities; and (3) to establish the generalizability of prior work in the identification of privacy protections and vulnerabilities from privacy policies to other policy documents. Our results suggest that this requirements analysis technique, developed on a small set of policy documents in two domains, may generalize to other domains.

We use the idea of a “dimension,” developed previously in our case-based reasoning system HYPO, to analyze the hypotheticals and to speculate on how the Justices might have arrived at them. The case we consider is taken from the area of Fourth Amendment law concerning warrantless search and seizure.

PY  - 1996
AB  - This paper describes a model of legal reasoning and a logic for reasoning with rules, principles and goals that is especially suited to this model of legal reasoning. The paper consists of three parts. The first part describes a model of legal reasoning based on a two-layered view of the law. The first layer consists of principles and goals that express fundamental ideas of a legal system. The second layer contains legal rules which in a sense summarise the outcome of the interaction of the principles and goals for a number of case types. Both principles, goals and rules can be used in legal arguments, but their logical roles are different. One characteristic of the model of legal reasoning described in the first part of the paper is that it takes these logical differences into account. Another characteristic is that it pays serious attention to the phenomena of reasoning about the validity and acceptance of rules, respectively principles and goals, and about the application of legal rules, and the implications of these arguments for the use of rules, principles and goals in deriving legal conclusions for concrete cases.

The second part of the paper first describes a logic (Reason-Based Logic) that is especially suited to deal with legal arguments as described in terms of the previously discussed model. The facilities of the logic are illustrated by means of examples that correspond to the several aspects of the model.

The third part of the paper deals with a number of logico-philosophical reflections on Reason-Based Logic. The occasion is also used to compare these presuppositions with theories of defeasible reasoning based on the comparison of arguments.

AB  - A contract is a legally binding agreement between real-world business entities whom we treat as providing services to one another. We focus on business rather than technical services. We think of a business contract as specifying the functional and nonfunctional behaviors of and interactions among the services. In current practice, contracts are produced as text documents. Thus the relevant service capabilities, requirements, qualities, and risks are hidden and difficult to access and reason about. We describe a simple but effective unsupervised information extraction approach and tool, Contract Miner, for discovering service exceptions at the phrase level from a large contract repository. Our approach involves preprocessing followed by an application of linguistic patterns and parsing to extract the service exception phrases. Identifying such (noun) phrases can help build service exception vocabularies that support the development of a taxonomy of business terms, and also facilitate modeling and analyzing service engagements. A lightweight online tool that comes with Contract Miner highlights the relevant text in service contracts and thereby assists users in reviewing contracts. Contract Miner produces promising results in terms of precision and recall when evaluated over a corpus of manually annotated contracts.

AB  - Abstract This paper reviews the evidence for Redish's (1979) seven propositions concerning legal text. These propositions are: (i) many legal documents cannot be read and understood by lay persons; (ii) people without legal training have to read and understand legal documents; (iii) much legal writing is unintelligible, even to lawyers; (iv) tradition – not necessity – and a lack of understanding of the audience – are the major reasons that legal language is so obscure; (v) legal language can be made clear without losing its precision; (vi) it is not the technical vocabulary but the complex sentence structure that makes legal writing difficult to understand; and (vii) clarity is not the same as simplicity, brevity or ‘Plain English’. The evidence supports all of these propositions, except perhaps the fifth and sixth. The research shows that writing legal text requires more attention to be given to readers than is typically the case.

AB  - Establishing secure systems assurance based on Certification and Accreditation (C&A) activities, requires effective ways to understand the enforced security requirements, gather relevant evidences, perceive related risks in the operational environment, and reveal their causal relationships with other domain concepts. However, C&A security requirements are expressed in multiple regulatory documents with complex interdependencies at different levels of abstractions that often result in subjective interpretations and non-standard implementations. Their non-functional nature imposes complex constraints on the emergent behavior of software-intensive systems, making them hard to understand, predict, and control. To address these issues, we present novel techniques from software requirements engineering and knowledge engineering for systematically extracting, modeling, and analyzing security requirements and related concepts from multiple C&A-enforced regulatory documents. We employ advanced ontological engineering processes as our primary modeling technique to represent complex and diverse characteristics of C&A security requirements and related domain knowledge. We apply our methodology to build problem domain ontology from regulatory documents enforced by the Department of Defense Information Technology Security Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP).

AB  - Regulations are a source of evolving requirements for products and organizations. As regulatory institutions shift towards outcome-based regulations, they increasingly adopt legislation performance modeling, at the basis of regulatory intelligence. In this context, performance modeling refers to the measuring of important business aspects in a coordinated manner and the use of these measurements for improved decision making. Considering that in many cases regulatory texts already exist, it is necessary to build a performance model based on existing regulations that may be still prescriptive rather than outcome-based. The process of turning the underlying textual legislation into a formal performance model that can be assessed by Business Intelligence (BI) tools is complicated due to organizational, cultural, and technological reasons. In this paper, we present a methodology from a technical perspective that enables regulatory institutions to reason about regulations and compliance with regulations as new dimensions. We demonstrate the methodology using traffic law as an example regulation, jUCMNav for performance modeling, and IBM Cognos for BI reporting.

AB  - This paper studies how legal choices, and in particular legislative determinations, need to consider multiple rights and values, and can be assessed accordingly. First it is argued that legal norms (and in particular constitutional right-norms) often prescribe the pursuit of goals, which may be in conflict one with another. Then a model of teleological reasoning is brought to bear on choices affecting different goals, among which those prescribed by constitutional norms. An analytical framework is provided for evaluating such choices with regard to possible alternatives. The assessment of legislative choices according to proportionality is then considered, and is modelled using the provided analytical framework. Finally, the framework is expanded to include the ideas of reasonableness and institutional deference, and the corresponding margins of appreciation.

AB  - Most recent work on reasoning with cases in law has taken the style of rea- soning used in the CATO system as its model, and uses the notion of factors, as found in that system. Fundamental to CATO, a successor the HYPO system, were factors, which are closely related to HYPO-style dimensions. In this paper, we will argue that the simplification involved in using factors, while it has proved pragmatically useful both for clarifying understanding of certain aspects of reasoning with cases and for implementation, causes problems with domain analysis and precludes certain kinds of argument that we would wish to model. We therefore believe that the time is now ripe to go back to the original notion of dimensions, while retaining the insights that have been gained from working with the simpler notion of factors. The paper uses two case studies to argue that this is so.

AB  - This paper describes an approach to legal logic based on the formal analysis of argumentation schemes. Argumentation schemes - a notion borrowed from the field of argumentation theory - are a kind of generalized rules of inference, in the sense that they express that given certain premises a particular conclusion can be drawn. However, argumentation schemes need not concern strict, abstract, necessarily valid patterns of reasoning, but can be defeasible, concrete and contingently valid, i.e., valid in certain contexts or under certain circumstances. A method is presented to analyze argumentation schemes and it is shown how argumentation schemes can be embedded in a formal model of dialectical argumentation. The approach also provides insight into the role of critical questions.

AB  - A given business process may face a large number of regulatory obligations the process may or comply with. Providing tools and techniques to evaluate the compliance degree of a given process is a key objective in emerging business process platforms. We propose a diagnostic framework to assess the compliance gaps present in a given process. Checking whether a process is compliant with the rules involves enumerating all reachable states and is hence, in general, a hard search problem. The approach taken here allows to provide useful diagnostic information in polynomial time based on two underlying techniques. A conceptually faithful representation for regulatory obligations is firstly provided by a formal rule language based on a non-monotonic deontic logic of violations. Secondly, processes are formalized through semantic annotations that allow a logical state space to be created. The intersection of the two allows us to devise an efficient method to detect compliance gaps.

First, a systematic process is outlined which, given a problem and a collection of legal prescriptions, generates a set of requirements that address the problem while complying with the prescriptions. Second, the conceptual framework is outlined, which characterises the process by providing both legal concepts proposed in theoretical studies in the legal domain and concepts from goal-oriented requirements engineering. The issues and challenges of the proposed framework are also evaluated, with regard to expected results.

AB  - Research in requirements engineering has produced an extensive body of knowledge, but there are four areas in which the foundation of the discipline seems weak or obscure. This article shines some light in the “four dark corners,” exposing problems and proposing solutions. We show that all descriptions involved in requirements engineering should be descriptions of the environment. We show that certain control information is necessary for sound requirements engineering, and we explain the close association between domain knowledge and refinement of requirements. Together these conclusions explain the precise nature of requirements, specifications, and domain knowledge, as well as the precise nature of the relationships among them. They establish minimum standards for what  information should be represented in a requirements language. They also make it possible to determine exactly what it means for requirements and engineering to be successfully completed.

AB  - This paper describes ON-LINE (ONtology-based Legal Information Environment), an architecture for a legal workbench which combines two major functions: legal information serving and legal analysis. Some of the main features of ON-LINE are: the integrated storage and representation of legal text and knowledge by using interconnected knowledge aud text repositories; a representation of legal knowledge based on a functional ontology of law; the emphssis on legal modelling as a central task in legal practice. ON-LINE comprises three main modules. The Legal Information Server is able to retrieve legal information baaed on either textnal or conceptual search. The Legal Information ModelZing Toolkit is a collection of integrated tools to transform legaJ text into legal knowledge. The Legal Analysis Environment contains reasoning tools to perform two of the central legal tasks: assessment and planning. The architecture is intended to be a basis for experimentation, and it is therefore highly extensible. ONLINE is partially implemented in Common Lisp and it is supported by the LOOM system.

AB  - The complexity and diversity of government regulations make understanding the regulations a non-trivial task. One of the issues is the existence of multiple sources of regulations and interpretive guides; the latter are often independent of governing bodies. This work aims to develop an information infrastructure for legal information retrieval with applications to electronic-rulemaking. The pilot study focuses on accessibility regulations from the US Federal government, private organizations and European agencies. A shallow parser is developed to consolidate different regulations into a unified XML format, which is well suited for handling semi-structured data such as legal documents. Handcrafted rules and a text mining tool are developed to extract the important features, such as concepts, measurements, effective dates and so on, and to incorporate them into the corpus.To compare and locate related provisions from different regulatory documents, we employ Information Retrieval techniques to combine generic features with domain knowledge. Structural information from regulations, such as the hierarchical organization of provisions and heavy referencing among provisions, are used to help improve the relatedness analysis. Results are obtained to illustrate the use of regulatory structure and domain knowledge in provision comparisons. Application to an e-rulemaking scenario for a rights-of-way drafted regulation is shown to demonstrate extended capabilities of the prototype system.

AB  - Large-scale software systems must adhere to complex, multi-lateral security and privacy requirements from regulations. It is industrial practice to define such requirements in form of natural language (NL) documents. Currently existing approaches to analyzing NL confidentiality requirements rely on a manual linguistic transformation and normalization of the original text, prior to the analysis. This paper presents an alternative approach to analyzing requirements by using semantic annotations placed directly into the original NL documents. The benefits of this alternative approach are twofold: (1) it can effectively be supported by an interactive annotation tool and (2) there is a direct traceability between annotation structures and the original NL documents. We have evaluated our method and tool support using the same real-world case study that was used to evaluate the earlier linguistic approach. Our results show that our method generates the same results, i.e., it uncovers the same problems.

AB  - Online privacy policies describe organizations’ privacy practices for collecting, storing, using, and protecting consumers’ personal information. Users need to understand these policies in order to know how their personal information is being collected, stored, used, and protected. Organizations need to ensure that the commitments they express in their privacy policies reflect their actual business practices, especially in the United States where the Federal Trade Commission regulates fair business practices. Requirements engineers need to understand the privacy policies to know the privacy practices with which the software must comply and to ensure that the commitments expressed in these privacy policies are incorporated into the software requirements. In this paper, we present a methodology for obtaining requirements from privacy policies based on our theory of commitments, privileges, and rights, which was developed through a grounded theory approach. This methodology was developed from a case study in which we derived software requirements from seventeen healthcare privacy policies. We found that legal-based approaches do not provide sufficient coverage of privacy requirements because privacy policies focus primarily on procedural practices rather than legal practices.

AB  - A-HOHFELD is a representational language used in MINT (Multiple INTerpretation) Interpretation-Assistance (expert) systems for precisely expressing alternative structural interpretations of sets of legal rules. It draws heavily upon the timlamental legal conceptions formulated by Wesley N. HoMeld at the dawn of the Twentieth Century. In the current version of AHOHFELD the original conceptions have been modified and extended in seeking to define a language sufficiently robust to express all LEGAL RELATIONS and all changes in legal states of affairs. Hohfeld emphasized the use of fundamental legal conceptions in the analysis of judicial reasoning, elsewhere we have shown the use of A-HOHFELD for the analysis of sets of statutory rules, and here we illustrate its use in thinking about legal doctrine. This use of A-HOHFELD is offered as a possible example of where fluency in a more precise and complete language might have facilitated an earlier recognition of remedial alternatives that have apparently only recently been appearing in legal literature and judicial decisions. To the extent that AHOHFELD so strengthens legal analysis, it farther exemplifies how work on problems of artificial intelligence in computer science tiuittidly feeds back to law and illustrates how precision in language contributes to thought as well as communication.

PY  - 1989
AB  - Logic programs represent knowledge in the form of  implications  A if B 1  and … B n , n ≥ 0 where the  conclusion  A is an atomic formula and each  condition  B i  is either an atomic formula or the negation of an atomic formula. Any variables are assumed to be universally quantified, with a scope which is the entire sentence. A negated condition “not A i ” is deemed to hold if the corresponding positive condition A i  can be shown to fail to hold. This interpretation of negative conditions is called negation by failure (NBF) [Cl 78]. It has the characteristic that only the positive “if-half” of a definition needs to be given explicity. The negative “only-if” half is given implicitly by NBF.  The obvious problem with NBF is that it supplies the only-if halves of implications, whether or not they are intended. I shall discuss a possible solution to this problem in the context of discussing the more general problem of representing negative conclusions. I shall focus on examples taken from our formalisation of the 1981 British Nationality Act (BNA) [SSKKHC 86]. I shall argue that many negative sentences can be regarded as integrity constraints and consequently can be eliminated by transformations such as those developed by Asirelli et al [ASM 85] and Kowalski and Sadri [KS 88]. Among such sentences are ones expressing prohibitions. The interpretation of prohibitions as integrity constraints suggests a possible approach to the treatment of deontic modalities.

AB  - Organizations in privacy-regulated industries (e.g. healthcare and financial institutions) face significant challenges when developing policies and systems that are properly aligned with relevant privacy legislation. We analyze privacy regulations derived from the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) that affect information sharing practices and consumer privacy in healthcare systems. Our analysis shows specific natural language semantics that formally characterize rights, obligations, and the meaningful relationships between them required to build value into systems. Furthermore, we evaluate semantics for rules and constraints necessary to develop machine-enforceable policies that bridge between laws, policies, practices, and system requirements. We believe the results of our analysis will benefit legislators, regulators and policy and system developers by focusing their attention on natural language policy semantics that are implementable in software systems.

We describe a requirements extraction model, a set of rules for specifying the format of the extracted information, a set of UML-based principles for translating the extracted information into a language based on predicate logic, and finally, a tool that analyzes the resulting logic model and displays the results of the analysis. The translation principles are based on a Governance Analysis Model (GAM) which is described in UML; the language is our Governance Analysis Language (GAL) and the tool is our Governance Analysis Tool (GAT). MIT's logic analyzer Alloy is the engine on which GAT runs. GAL is translated into assertions in Alloy's language and the Alloy tool can find counterexamples indicating situations of non-compliance.

AB  - This article presents a formal dialogue game for adjudication dialogues. Existing AI & law models of legal dialogues and argumentation-theoretic models of persuasion are extended with a neutral third party, to give a more realistic account of the adjudicator's role in legal procedures. The main feature of the model is a division into an argumentation phase, where the adversaries plea their case and the adjudicator has a largely mediating role, and a decision phase, where the adjudicator decides the dispute on the basis of the claims, arguments and evidence put forward in the argumentation phase. The model allows for explicit decisions on admissibility of evidence and burden of proof by the adjudicator in the argumentation phase. Adjudication is modelled as putting forward arguments, in particular undercutting and priority arguments, in the decision phase. The model reconciles logical aspects of burden of proof induced by the defeasible nature of arguments with dialogical aspects of burden of proof as something that can be allocated by explicit decisions on legal grounds.

It requires a comprehensive framework for dealing with compliance requirements: elicitation, modeling, static and dynamic checking and reporting. We previously defined CoReL, a domain specific language for the domain of compliance decision-making. This paper shows how CoReL can be used to model compliance requirements using an illustrative example. In particular, we show how CoReL's agnosticism of logical formalisms and coverage of enterprise business aspects leverages the task of compliance modeling to the business user level.

AB  - Goal-oriented languages have been used for years to model and reason about functional, non-functional, and legal requirements. It is however difficult to develop and maintain these models, especially when many models overlap with each other. This becomes an even bigger challenge when a single, generic model is used to capture a family of related goal models but different evaluations are required for each individual family member. In this work, we use ITU-T's Goal-oriented Requirement Language (GRL) and the jUCMNav tool to illustrate the problem and to formulate a solution that exploits the flexibility of standard GRL. In addition, we report on our recent experience on the modeling of aerodrome regulations. We demonstrate the usefulness of specifying families of goal models to address challenges associated with the maintenance of models used in the regulatory domain. We finally define and illustrate a new tool-supported algorithm used to evaluate individual goal models that are members of the larger family model.

AB  - The sequence and timing constraints on the activities in business processes are an important aspect of business process compliance. To date, these constraints are most often implicitly transcribed into control-flow-based process models. This implicit representation of constraints, however, complicates the verification, validation and reuse in business process design. In this paper, we investigate the use of temporal deontic assignments on activities as a means to declaratively capture the control-flow semantics that reside in business regulations and business policies. In particular, we introduce PENELOPE, a language to express temporal rules about the obligations and permissions in a business interaction, and an algorithm to generate compliant sequence-flow-based process models that can be used in business process design.

AB  - The increasing use of personal information on Web-based applications can result in unexpected disclosures. Consumers often have only the stated Web site policies as a guide to how their information is used, and thus on which to base their browsing and transaction decisions. However, each policy is different, and it is difficult—if not impossible—for the average user to compare and comprehend these policies. This paper presents a taxonomy of privacy requirements for Web sites. Using goal-mining, the extraction of pre-requirements goals from post-requirements text artefacts, we analysed an initial set of Internet privacy policies to develop the taxonomy. This taxonomy was then validated during a second goal extraction exercise, involving privacy policies from a range of health care related Web sites. This validation effort enabled further refinement to the taxonomy, culminating in two classes of privacy requirements: protection goals and vulnerabilities. Protection goals express the desired protection of consumer privacy rights, whereas vulnerabilities describe requirements that potentially threaten consumer privacy. The identified taxonomy categories are useful for analysing implicit internal conflicts within privacy policies, the corresponding Web sites, and their manner of operation. These categories can be used by Web site designers to reduce Web site privacy vulnerabilities and ensure that their stated and actual policies are consistent with each other. The same categories can be used by customers to evaluate and understand policies and their limitations. Additionally, the policies have potential use by third-party evaluators of site policies and conflicts.

PY  - 2003
AB  - Assumptions are often not considered to be definitely true, but only as prima facie justified. When an assumption is prima facie justified, there can for instance be a reason against it, by which the assumption is not actually justified. The assumption is then said to be defeated. This requires a revision of the standard conception of logical interpretation of sets of assumptions in terms of their models. Whereas in the models of a set of assumptions, all assumptions are taken to be true, an interpretation of prima facie justified assumptions must distinguish between the assumptions that are actually justified in the interpretation and those that are defeated. In the present paper, the logical interpretation of prima facie justified assumptions is investigated. The central notion is that of a dialectical interpretation of a set of assumptions. The basic idea is that a prima facie justified assumption is not actually justified, but defeated when its so-called dialectical negation is justified. The properties of dialectical interpretation are analysed by considering partial dialectical interpretations, or stages, and by establishing the notion of dialectical justification. The latter leads to a characterization of the existence and multiplicity of the dialectical interpretations of a set of assumptions. Since dialectical interpretations are a variant of stable semantics, the results are relevant for existing work on nonmonotonic logic and defeasible reasoning, on which the present work builds. Instead of focusing on defeasible rules or arguments, the present approach is sentence-based. A particular innovation is the use of a conditional that is prima facie justified (just like other assumptions) instead of an inconclusive conditional.

AB  - Software engineering standards determine practices that "compliant" software processes shall follow. Standards generally define practices in terms of constraints that must hold for documents. The document types identified by standards include typical development products, such as user requirements, and also process-oriented documents, such as progress reviews and management reports. The degree of standards compliance can be established by checking these documents against the constraints. It is neither practical nor desirable to enforce compliance at all points in the development process. Thus, compliance must be managed rather than imposed. We outline a model of standards and compliance and illustrate it with some examples. We give a brief account of the notations and method we have developed to support the use of the model and describe a support environment we have constructed. The principal contributions of our work are: the identification of the issue of standards compliance; the development of a model of standards and support for compliance management; the development of a formal model of product state with associated notation; a powerful policy scheme that triggers checks; and a flexible and scalable compliance management view.

We show how collaborative requirements engineering can be supported using a planner, domain abstractions, and automated decision science techniques. In particular we show how requirements conflict resolution can be assisted through a combination of multi-agent multi-criteria optimization and heuristic resolution generation. We then summarize the use of our tool to rationally reconstruct a library specification. This line of research is significant in that it brings conflict detection and resolution into a requirements engineering framework.

It is more complicated than single system requirements engineering because of the conflicting requirements across the product lines, the effect of evolution on the reuse and customization, and the global distribution of product line organizations. As product lines are long-term investments, handling their evolution is critical. This paper proposes a new technique called rationale-based product line evolution. It is based on the Questions, Options and Criteria model and a modified version of EasyWinWin. The technique allows the evaluation of change requests in product line requirements based on the informal collaboration of stakeholders, capturing the forces that cause evolution and using them for the justification of change requests. The technique has been implemented in the Sysiphus tool and was validated using empirical evaluation.

AB  - Empirical software engineering research needs research guidelines to improve the research and reporting processes. We propose a preliminary set of research guidelines aimed at stimulating discussion among software researchers. They are based on a review of research guidelines developed for medical researchers and on our own experience in doing and reviewing software engineering research. The guidelines are intended to assist researchers, reviewers, and meta-analysts in designing, conducting, and evaluating empirical studies. Editorial boards of software engineering journals may wish to use our recommendations as a basis for developing guidelines for reviewers and for framing policies for dealing with the design, data collection, and analysis and reporting of empirical studies.

We argue that in order to improve the current situation we must create better studies and draw more credible interpretations from them. We finally present a roadmap for this improvement, which includes a general structure for software empirical studies and concrete steps for achieving these goals: designing better studies, collecting data more effectively, and involving others in our empirical enterprises.

AB  - In this paper we discuss a hybrid approach combining CaseBased Reasoning (CBR) and Information Retrieval (IR) for the retrieval of legal documents. Our hybrid CBR-IR approach takes as input a standard symbolic representation of a problem ease and retrieves texts of relevant cases from a document corpus dramatically larger than the case base available to the CBR system. Our system works by first performing a standard HYPO-style CBR anatysis and then using texts associated with certain important classes of cases found in this analysis to “seed” a modified version of INQUERY’s relevance feedback mechanism in order to generate a query. Our approach provides two benefits: it extends the reach of CBR (for retrievat purposes) to much larger corpora, and it enables the injection of knowledgebased techniques into traditional IR. We deseribe our CBRIR approach and report on on-going experiments performed in two different legal domains.

AB  - Goal-oriented requirements engineering uses modelling to improve domain understanding and requirements quality. Regulations and laws impose additional context and constraints on goals and can limit the satisfaction of stakeholder needs. Organisations and software developers need modelling tools to assess the degree to which business strategies are effective in ensuring that business goals are met while complying with applicable laws and regulations. In this paper, we analyse the capabilities of the Goal-oriented Requirement Language (GRL) in supporting such assessments. Our analysis is based on four scenarios involving healthcare business processes and compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.

AB  - Regulated companies are required to comply with the many laws, regulations, standards, and guidelines that apply to them. The sheer volume of regulatory compliance requirements for even a small company can be considerably high, which renders the understanding of such authoritative rules a challenging task without tool support. After inspecting several regulatory documents, we noticed that they contain a significant number of citations that, if explored effectively, can reveal important information about the containing documents. In this paper, we propose a technique called citation analysis that aims at helping users to understand and analyze regulatory documents in an efficient manner. Our approach is based on the exploration of citation graphs extracted from regulatory documents. We discuss the challenges when dealing with citations. We also present an overview of a tool that can support citation analysis.

AB  - The doctrine of precedent, as it has evolved within the common law, has at its heart a form of reasoning—broadly speaking, a logic—according to which the decisions of earlier courts in particular cases somehow generalize to constrain the decisions of later courts facing different cases, while still allowing these later courts a degree of freedom in responding to fresh circumstances. Although the techniques for arguing on the basis of precedent are taught early on in law schools, mastered with relative ease, and applied on a daily basis by legal practitioners, it has proved to be considerably more difficult to arrive at a theoretical understanding of the doctrine itself—a clear articulation of the underlying logic. My purpose in this paper is to describe a new framework within which we can begin to address this problem. I concentrate on two of the most fundamental questions in the theory of precedent. First, how is it, exactly, that precedent cases constrain future decisions—what is the mechanism of constraint? And second, how is a balance then achieved between the constraints of precedent and the freedoms allowed to later courts for developing the law? The view I present will be contrasted with three other views, or models, of precedential constraint appearing in the literature. The first is the rule model. A precedent case normally contains, not only a description of the facts of the case along with a decision on the basis of those facts, but also some particular rule through which that decision was reached. According to the rule model, it is this rule that carries the precedential constraint. Constraint by precedent just is constraint by rules; a precedent case constrains the decision of a later court when the rule contained in that precedent applies to the fact situation confronting the later court.

The elaborate discussion in chapter II of reasons and their relation to principles, goals and rules, should have substantiated this claim.

AB  - This paper proposes an argumentation-based procedure for legal interpretation, by reinterpreting the traditional canons of textual interpretation in terms of argumentation schemes, which are then classified, formalized, and represented through argument visualization and evaluation tools. The problem of statutory interpretation is framed as one of weighing contested interpretations as pro and con arguments. The paper builds an interpretation procedure by formulating a set of argumentation schemes that can be used to comparatively evaluate the types of arguments used in cases of contested statutory interpretation in law. A simplified version of the Carneades Argumentation System is applied in a case analysis showing how the procedure works. A logical model for statutory interpretation is finally presented, covering pro-tanto and all-things-considered interpretive conclusions.

AB  - This paper presents a methodology to design and implement programs intended to decide cases, described as sets of factors, according to a theory of a particular domain based on a set of precedent cases relating to that domain. We use Abstract Dialectical Frameworks (ADFs), a recent development in AI knowledge representation, as the central feature of our design method. ADFs will play a role akin to that played by Entity---Relationship models in the design of database systems. First, we explain how the factor hierarchy of the well-known legal reasoning system CATO can be used to instantiate an ADF for the domain of US Trade Secrets. This is intended to demonstrate the suitability of ADFs for expressing the design of legal cased based systems. The method is then applied to two other legal domains often used in the literature of AI and Law. In each domain, the design is provided by the domain analyst expressing the cases in terms of factors organised into an ADF from which an executable program can be implemented in a straightforward way by taking advantage of the closeness of the acceptance conditions of the ADF to components of an executable program. We evaluate the ease of implementation, the performance and efficacy of the resulting program, ease of refinement of the program and the transparency of the reasoning. This evaluation suggests ways in which factor based systems, which are limited by taking as their starting point the representation of cases as sets of factors and so abstracting away the particular facts, can be extended to address open issues in AI and Law by incorporating the case facts to improve the decision, and by considering justification and reasoning using portion of precedents.

AB  - Stories and legal cases have much in common, but there are also differences. Both can be seen as a sequence of events, but in a legal case the facts and events are legally qualified. Moreover, the point of a story is usually implicit, whereas the outcome of a legal case is explicitly explained. Stories have been mainly used in AI and Law to explore the evidence presented in legal cases, but here we will explore the relationship on the assumption the facts of the case have already been established, and so include legal qualification and the decision. We illustrate our approach the well known wild animals and Popov v Hayashi cases.

AB  - Using models for expressing legal requirements is now commonplace in Requirements Engineering. Models of legal requirements, on the one hand, facilitate communication between software engineers and legal experts, and on the other hand, provide a basis for systematic and automated analysis. The most prevalent application of legal requirements models is for checking the compliance of software systems with laws and regulations. In this experience paper, we explore a complementary application of legal requirements models, namely simulation. We observe that, in domains such as taxation, the same models that underlie legal compliance analysis bring important added value by enabling simulation. Concretely, this paper reports on the model-based simulation of selected legal requirements (policies) derived from Luxembourg's Income Tax Law. The simulation scenario considered in the paper is aimed at analyzing the impact of a current tax law reform proposal in Luxembourg. We describe our approach for simulation along with empirical results demonstrating the feasibility and accuracy of the approach. We further present lessons learned from the experience.

AB  - Historically, business process design has been driven by business objectives, specifically process improvement. However this cannot come at the price of control objectives which stem from various legislative, standard and business partnership sources. Ensuring the compliance to regulations and industrial standards is an increasingly important issue in the design of business processes. In this paper, we advocate that control objectives should be addressed at an early stage, i.e., design time, so as to minimize the problems of runtime compliance checking and consequent violations and penalties. To this aim, we propose supporting mechanisms for business process designers. This paper specifically presents a support method which allows the process designer to quantitatively measure the compliance degree of a given process model against a set of control objectives. This will allow process designers to comparatively assess the compliance degree of their design as well as be better informed on the cost of non-compliance.

AB  - Developing software systems in heavily regulated industries requires methods to ensure systems comply with regulations and law. An algorithm to generate finite state machines (FSM) from stakeholder rights and obligations for compliance monitoring is proposed. Rights and obligations define what people are permitted or required to do; these rights and obligations affect software requirements and design. The FSM allows stakeholders, software developers and compliance officers to trace events through the invocation of rights and obligations as preand postconditions. Compliance is monitored by instrumenting runtime systems to report these events and detect violations. Requirements and software engineers specify the rights and obligations, and our algorithm performs three supporting tasks: 1) identify ambiguities, 2) balance rights with obligations, and 3) generate finite state machines. Preliminary validation of the algorithm includes FSMs generated from U.S. healthcare regulations and tool support to parse these specifications and generate the FSMs.

AB  - Software engineers are being asked to develop software for increasingly regulated environments. When systems are not dependably compliant, companies must pay the high cost of non-compliance, including the cost of lost reputation and brand damage. Regulations represent the minimum level of security and dependability with which systems must comply. We develop a methodology for creating production rule models to aid developers in specifying legally compliant software requirements. By querying production rule models, software engineers can gain valuable knowledge of the legal text. They can perform an initial compliance analysis and obtain preliminary compliance requirements that can be further refined in consultation with a lawyer. We model the law using the legal concepts of rights, obligations, privileges, no-rights, powers, liabilities, immunities, and disabilities. Herein, we develop heuristics for specifying production rules that model legal texts. We refined our methodology within the context of a case study in which we model the Privacy Rule, Part E, of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

AB  - Over the last two decades, much attention has been paid to the area of goal-oriented requirements engineering (GORE), where goals are used as a useful conceptualization to elicit, model, and analyze requirements, capturing alternatives and conflicts. Goal modeling has been adapted and applied to many sub-topics within requirements engineering (RE) and beyond, such as agent orientation, aspect orientation, business intelligence, model-driven development, and security. Despite extensive efforts in this field, the RE community lacks a recent, general systematic literature review of the area. In this work, we present a systematic mapping study, covering the 246 top-cited GORE-related conference and journal papers, according to Scopus. Our literature map addresses several research questions: we classify the types of papers (e.g., proposals, formalizations, meta-studies), look at the presence of evaluation, the topics covered (e.g., security, agents, scenarios), frameworks used, venues, citations, author networks, and overall publication numbers. For most questions, we evaluate trends over time. Our findings show a proliferation of papers with new ideas and few citations, with a small number of authors and papers dominating citations; however, there is a slight rise in papers which build upon past work (implementations, integrations, and extensions). We see a rise in papers concerning adaptation/variability/evolution and a slight rise in case studies. Overall, interest in GORE has increased. We use our analysis results to make recommendations concerning future GORE research and make our data publicly available.

AB  - The abstract nature of Dung’s theory of argumentation accounts for its wide-spread application as a general framework for various species of non-monotonic reasoning, and, more generally, reasoning in the presence of conflict. In this article, we formalize reasoning about argumentation within the Dung argumentation paradigm itself. A metalevel Dung argumentation framework is itself instantiated by arguments that make statements about arguments, their interactions, and their evaluation in an object-level argumentation framework.We show how Dung’s theory, and object-level extensions of Dung’s theory, such as those intended to accommodate preferences, can then be uniformly characterised by metalevel argumentation in a Dung framework. We then discuss how this provides for application of the full range of theoretical and practical developments of Dung’s theory, to extensions of Dung’s theory, and provides for integration and further augmentation of these extensions.

AB  - In the course of legal reasoning--whether for purposes of deciding an issue, justifying a decision, predicting how an issue will be decided, or arguing for how it should be decided--one often is required to reach (and assert) conclusions based on a balance of reasons that is not straightforwardly reducible to the application of rules. Recent AI and Law work has modeled reason-balancing, both within and across cases, with set-theoretic and rule- or value-ordering approaches. This article explores a way to model balancing in quantitative terms that may yield new questions, insights, and tools.

AB  - In this article, we introduce the application of rigorous analysis procedures to goal models to provide several benefits beyond the initial act of modeling. Such analysis can allow modelers to assess the satisfaction of goals, facilitate evaluation of high-level design alternatives, help analysts decide on the high-level requirements and design of the system, test the sanity of a model, and support communication and learning. The analysis of goal models can be done in very different ways depending on the nature of the model and the purpose of the analysis. In our work, we use the Goal-oriented Requirement Language (GRL), which is part of the User Requirements Notation (URN). URN, a new Recommendation of the International Telecommunications Union, provides the first standard goal-oriented language. Using GRL, we develop an approach to analysis that can be done by evaluating qualitative or quantitative satisfaction levels of the actors and intentional elements (e.g., goals and tasks) composing the model. Initial satisfaction levels for some of the intentional elements are provided in a strategy and then propagated to the other intentional elements of the model through the various links that connect them. The results allow for an assessment of the relative effectiveness of design alternatives at the requirements level. Although no specific propagation algorithm is imposed in the URN standard, different criteria for defining evaluation mechanisms are described. We provide three algorithms (quantitative, qualitative, and hybrid) as examples, which satisfy the constraints imposed by the standard. These algorithms have been implemented in the open-source jUCMNav tool, an Eclipse-based editor for URN models. The algorithms are presented and compared with the help of a telecommunication system example. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Requirements engineering is the process of discovering, documenting and managing the requirements for a computer-based system. The goal of requirements engineering is to produce a set of system requirements which, as far as possible, is complete, consistent, relevant and reflects what the customer actually wants. Although this ideal is probably unattainable, the use of a systematic approach based on engineering principles leads to better requirements than the informal approach which is still commonly used. This book presents a set of guidelines which reflect the best practice in requirements engineering. Based on the authors' experience in research and in software and systems development, these guidelines explain in an easy-to-understand way how you can improve your requirements engineering processes. The guidelines are applicable for any type of application and, in general, apply to both systems and software engineering.

AB  - A formal model is proposed of argumentation with burdens and standards of proof, overcoming shortcomings of earlier work. The model is based on a distinction between default and inverted burdens of proof. This distinction is formalised by adapting the definition of defeat of the ASPIC+ framework for structured argumentation. Since ASPIC+ generates abstract argumentation frameworks, the model is thus given a Dungean semantics. It is shown to adequately capture shifting proof burdens as well as Carneades’ definitions of proof standards.

AB  - For thousands of years people have realized the importance of archiving and finding information. With the advent of computers, it became possible to store large amounts of information; and finding useful information from such collections became a necessity. The field of Information Retrieval (IR) was born in the 1950s out of this necessity. Over the last forty years, the field has matured considerably. Several IR systems are used on an everyday basis by a wide variety of users. This article is a brief overview of the key advances in the field of Information Retrieval, and a description of where the state-of-the-art is at in the field.

We go on to discuss one of these dialogue types persuasion in the context of practical reasoning and the problems associated with such reasoning. We propose a perspective on practical reasoning as presumptive justification and critical questions, giving an extension to the account proposed by Walton [24]. This provides us with a foundation for a protocol, named PARMA, for a dialogue game based on this theory. We go on to give an axiomatic and denotational semantics for PARMA and discuss two implementations based on PARMA.

AB  - A considerable number of methods and tools have been proposed for the treatment of non-functional requirements (NFRs). There is ample evidence that NFRs play a significant role in the Information Systems Engineering process. However, there is surprisingly an absence of an agreed position regarding the definition of NFRs, their classification and presentation. This paper reports on a systematic literature review of the documented NFR approaches, classifies these approaches according to different criteria and provides a qualitative analysis of their scopes and characteristics. The results of this analysis can serve system developers as the means of deriving appropriate methods and tools of NFRs engineering process in the system development.

AB  - People tend to improve their abilities to reason about situations by amassing experiences in reasoning. The more situations which a person knows about, the more able he is to account for feature differences between a new input and old knowledge. A computer program which can improve its ability to reason must also have access to situations which it has previously analyzed or reasoned about. Previous experiences thus require some mechanism for orderly storage and retrieval. The inability to save accounts of previous experiences for future application and modification represents a serious shortcoming of most, if not all, rule-based expert systems.

AB  - Regulatory compliance is gaining attention from information systems engineers who must design systems that at the same time satisfy stakeholder requirements and comply with applicable laws. In our previous work, we have introduced a conceptual modelling language called Nomos 2 that aids requirements engineers analyze law to identify alternative ways for compliance. This paper presents an implemented reasoning tool that supports analysis of law models. The technical contributions of the paper include the formalization of reasoning mechanisms, their implementation in the NRTool, as well as an elaborated evaluation framework intended to determine whether the tool is scalable with respect to problem size, complexity as well as search space. The results of our experiments with the tool suggest that this conceptual modelling approach scales to real life regulatory compliance problems.

AB  - Legal case factors are textually represented facts which are represented in reported legal case decisions. Precedent decisions contribute to the decision of a case under consideration. As textually represented facts, factors linguistically encode semantic properties and relationships among the entities which can be leveraged to identify and extract the legal case factors from decisions. We integrate legal and linguistic resources in a text analysis tool with which we annotate textual passages. Using annotations tailored to legal case factors, the legal researcher can rapidly zero in on textual spans which represent specific combinations of factors, participants, and semantic properties which bear on who played what role with respect to a factor. The research reports progress on the development of a tool.

Using our semantic definitions, we then derive a number of intuitively plausible inferences, and we show generally that the paradoxes which are so frequently associated with deontic logic do not arise in our system.

AB  - Business process compliance management is an important part of corporate governance as it helps meet objectives while avoiding consequences and penalties. Although there is much research in this area, we believe goal-oriented compliance management using Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure the compliance level of organizations is an area that can be further developed. To investigate this hypothesis, we undertook a systematic literature review, querying four major search engines and performing manual searches in related workshops and citations. From a research body consisting of 198 articles and their references, we have systematically selected 32 papers. We grouped these papers into five categories and highlighted their main contributions. The results show that all selected papers were written in the last five years, and that few effectively represent compliance results using dashboards or similar tools. Although all individual pieces are available, no existing solution yet combines goals with KPIs for measuring the overall compliance level of an organization.

AB  - Due to increase of electronic business and business process dematerialization organizations are facing today a problem of preserving vast amounts of electronic documents in coherent and trustworthy manner. A large amount of digital documents are produced every day even in small and medium-sized companies. The documents range from simple receipts to complex legal contracts and service level agreements. Many such documents need to be stored and preserved for longer period of time. Some services and technical solutions providing long term proofs of authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation of electronic documents are available on the market today. In order for these technical electronic archiving solutions and services to be successfully adopted by organizations they need to be deployed in a proper operational and organizational manner. Beside this organization needs to establish required operational procedures and to operate in accordance with them to assure that trusted electronic archive is legally valid. In this paper we present the first set of organizational approaches that organizations need to utilize in order to successfully integrate the operational and legal aspects of electronic archiving and to change the business processes accordingly. Following the approach of pattern oriented organizational design we capture the organizational trusted archiving solutions and best practices in the form of patterns, providing the context of the problem, the generic solution captured in the form of organizational diagrams, and preconditions that need to be met by the organization, and dependencies on other patterns are described. Finally the paper presents implementation of the generic solution to different organizations' contexts and indicates influence of different applications of the pattern to further solution development.

AB  - One of the most interesting developments within contemporary legal theory has been the increasing importance accorded to the concept of interpretation. It is fortunately no longer possible to speak uncritically of, or simply to assume, the communicational and linguistic dimensions of legal regulation or of legal institutional discourse. While the concepts of communicationof discourse, language, text and sign-have long been key terms of debate within philosophy, literary theory and cultural studies, it is really only very recently that lawyers and particularly the legal academy have begun to take a serious if somewhat defensive interest in these disputes. The issues raised and the interests threatened are ponderous and vast; many of the dogmatic articles of legal faith are at stake and it should not be viewed as surprising if the debates as to the substantive implications of different forms of interpretation appear at times extreme and the positions adopted seem labored or untenable. The issues raised are intrinsically political: a direct challenge is presented to the traditionally established motive and characteristics of legal method, the humanistic tenets of legal philology are denied, and the liberal ideology of the rule of law itself is again placed in question. In such a context the current jurisprudential debates have an uncharacteristic urgency, for it is not simply the legal educational apparatus that is asked to change its course but, more dramatically, it is substantive legal practice and the corresponding professional status or standing of the law that are placed in balance. Clearly the issues adverted to are too broad to form anything more than a general though dynamic context to the present inquiry into the historical status of the legal text as object of interpretation.

The moves concern two ways of reinterpreting a general rule used in an argument, viz. by 'unpacking' and 'refining' the rule. The moves can be made not only by the user but also by the attacker of the rule, in order to reveal new ways to attack it. The new dialogue game is illustrated with examples from legal evidential reasoning, in which these types of moves are particularly common.

AB  - Introduction   The goal of our research over the past ten years has been to understand the cognitive strategies that individual jurors use to process trial information in order to make a decision prior to deliberation. We have approached this goal with the perspective of psychologists who are interested in how people think and behave. First, we have developed a theory that we believe describes the cognitive strategies that jurors use. We call this theory the story model, and it is described in the first section of the paper. Second, we have conducted extensive empirical work to test the theory. This work is summarized in the second section of the paper. The story model has been developed in the context of criminal trials, so it will be presented and discussed in those terms. In the final section of the paper, we discuss some of our current research directions.   The story model   We call our theory the story model because we propose that a central cognitive process in juror decision making is  story construction  (Bennett & Feldman, 1981; Pennington, 1981, 1991; Pennington & Hastie, 1980, 1981a, 1981b, 1986, 1988, 1992). Although story construction is central in our theory and has been the focus of most of our empirical research, it is but one of three processes that we propose.

AB  - One of the main problems of requirements elicitation is expressing customer requirements in a form that can be understood not only by requirements engineers but also by noncomputer professional customers and users. The usual choice for expressing elicited requirements is natural language, since it is frequently the only common language to all participants. Problems of natural language are well–known, but using more formal notations too early is a risky choice that can make requirements impossible to understand for customers and users. Moreover, requirements engineers do not usually have good writing skills, and sometimes semantically correct requirements, expressed in natural language, are not understood because of the way they are written. In this paper, we present requirements templates that can improve requirements elicitation and expression, and two kinds of patterns: linguistic patterns, which are very used sentences in natural language requirements descriptions that can be parameterized and integrated into templates, and requirements patterns, which are generic requirements templates that are found very often during the requirements elicitation process and that can be reused with some adaptation.

AB  - The practices of public surveillance, which include the monitoring of individuals in public through a variety of media (e.g., video, data, online), are among the least understood and controversial challenges to privacy in an age of information technologies. The fragmentary nature of privacy policy in the United States reflects not only the oppositional pulls of diverse vested interests, but also the ambivalence of unsettled intuitions on mundane phenomena such as shopper cards, closed-circuit television, and biometrics. This Article, which extends earlier work on the problem of privacy in public, explains why some of the prominent theoretical approaches to privacy, which were developed over time to meet traditional privacy challenges, yield unsatisfactory conclusions in the case of public surveillance. It posits a new construct, “contextual integrity,” as an alternative benchmark for privacy, to capture the nature of challenges posed by information technologies. Contextual integrity ties adequate protection for privacy to norms of specific contexts, demanding that information gathering and dissemination be appropriate to that context and obey the governing norms of distribution within it. Building on the idea of “spheres of justice,” developed by political philosopher Michael Walzer, this Article argues that public surveillance violates a right to privacy because it violates contextual integrity; as such, it constitutes injustice and even tyranny.

The most significant exception is probably deliberation dialogue, where some recent work has begun to tentatively investigate burden of proof in that setting. In this paper, I survey work on burden of proof in the artificial intelligence literature on argumentation, and offer some thoughts on how this work might be extended to the other types of dialogue recognized by Walton and Krabbe (1995) that so far do not appear to have been much investigated in this regard.

However, research has not yet provided a non-ambiguous and agreed-upon definition of RCM, and it is hard for newcomers to this field of research to get a clear overview of available results. This paper surveys and analyzes solutions proposed in research on RCM from the perspective of BPM, and gives an insight into the current strengths and limitations of solutions to RCM applied to BPM. We extract a set of evaluation criteria on RCM elicited from the surveyed works and proceed to a comparative analysis of the latter against the identified requirements.

AB  - Defeasible Deontic Logic is a simple and computationally efficient approach for the representation of normative reasoning. Traditionally defeasible logics are defined proof theoretically based on the proof conditions for the logic. While several logic programming, operational and argumentation semantics have been provided for defeasible logics, possible world semantics for (modal) defeasible logics remained elusive. In this paper we address this issue.

AB  - Robert Alexy is one of the main advocates of the so-called Rules and Principles Theory (hereafter: RPT). According to the RPT, legal norms can be divided into legal rules and legal principles. One of the main criteria for this distinction is-Alexy argues-that legal rules are applied by means of the Subsumption Formula, while legal principles-by means of the so-called Weight Formula (hereafter: WF). The WF offers an important insight into the structure of the process of balancing in legal reasoning. Alexy's proposal leads to many doubts and questions, however. The aim of the paper is to examine the appropriateness of the WF and the problem of balancing in legal reasoning from the perspective inspired by the constraint satisfaction theory of coherence, developed by Paul Thagard. My claim is that this theory enables us to elucidate many problematic features of the WF and to recast the structure of legal balancing in more transparent and efficient manner. The existing workable algorithms designed for computing other kinds of coherence-based reasoning (for instance, explanatory reasoning or analogical reasoning), make possible to adopt the programs employing these algorithms for computation of coherence in balancing of principles. However, the analysis presented here is mainly conceptual and it has only preparatory character in relation with the possible computational implementations in the future.

AB  - Agencies’ interpretations of ambiguous statutes under Chevron are not subject to a rule of stare decisis. Agencies may interpret and later reinterpret ambiguous statutes without settling the statute’s meaning. This article shows that this regime permits agencies to “interpret” law in legally unprincipled and inconsistent ways and prevents administrative statutes from meaningfully constraining agency policymaking. This article concludes that a rule of stare decisis should govern agencies’ interpretations of ambiguous statutes just as it governs judicial holdings. Taking seriously Chevron’s recognition of agencies’ power to interpret law, the conventional justifications for stare decisis – separation of powers, legislative supremacy, and the consistency of regulatory schemes – apply with equal force to agencies as to courts.

AB  - The word “ontology” is used with different senses in different communities. The most radical difference is perhaps between the philosophical sense, which has of course a well-established tradition, and the computational sense, which emerged in the recent years in the knowledge engineering community, starting from an early informal definition of (computational) ontologies as “explicit specifications of conceptualizations”. In this paper we shall revisit the previous attempts to clarify and formalize such original definition, providing a detailed account of the notions of conceptualization and explicit specification, while discussing at the same time the importance of shared explicit specifications.

AB  - It is commonplace that the informai fallacies constitute a branch of logic (though we should prefer to say "the analysis of argument") virtually bereft of theoretical articulation. In recent years, the practical importance of the study of informai fallacies has been recognized in many an introductory logic text, but very little systematic or sustained attention has been given to exploiting the potentialities of this important area. Fallacies hâve been of relatively constant interest since Aristotle, but on the whole the tendency has been to approach them intuitively and taxonomically rather than to pursue their theoretical aspects at appropriate levels of generality and systematicity. One need not hâve done very much teaching of introductory logic to appreciate that the lack of clear and adequate characterizations of the fallacies makes it virtually impossible to commend to students fallacy-theoretic notions as a really effective strategy in the analysis of argumentation. Yet there can be little doubt that the usefulness of such strategies for adjudicating actual argumentation in naturai language could be greatly advanced by a more systematic attempi to raise ourselves beyond mere intuitions about f allaciousness.

Here we describe a limited but expressive language designed to represent a wide range of ethics cases in SIROCCO, a world-wide web tool developed to perform case acquisition and support a measure of consistency in representation, and an experiment to validate the initial phase of SIROCCO's retrieval algorithm and test its sensitivity to small variations in case description.

AB  - Approaches to text generation have emphasised the need to plan dialogues between user and computer, but have paid insufficient attention to the highly conventional nature of much human-human interaction. It is possible to conceive of certain classes of dialogues as highly rule-governed activities, and to do so facilitates the planning of such dialogues, by decreasing the reliance on a model of the user. One such class of dialogue is interactive argument, in which a topic is discussed with the aim of reaching a conclusion as to the truth of some proposition. We contend that interactive argument provides a useful model of interaction with a KBS, could provide a novel means of knowledge elicitation, and would serve as a fruitful model for educational systems also. Details of a dialogue manager based on a well known dialogue game (Mackenzie’s DC) are given. Since KBS will exist independently of this way of interacting with them we give details of a Dialogue Abstract Machine (DAM), which could serve as a target interface between our dialogue manager and a KBS of any formalism.

AB  - Defeasible logic is a nonmonotonic reasoning approach based on rules and priorities. Its design supports efficient implementation, and it shows promise to be successfully deployed in applications.

So far only static priorities have been used, provided by an external superiority relation. In this paper we show how dynamic priorities can be integrated, where priority information is obtained from the deductive process itself. Dynamic priorities have been studied for other related reasoning systems, such as default logic and argumentation. We define a proof theory, study its formal properties, and provide an argumentation semantics.

However, norms can not be modeled directly as goals because of both an ontological difference, and an abstraction gap that causes the need to explore a potentially large space of alternatives. This paper presents the problem of deriving goals from norms and illustrates the open research challenges.

AB  - Every student of law has at some point encountered the “bright line rule” and the “flexible standard.” In one torts casebook, for instance, Oliver Wendell Holmes and Benjamin Cardozo find themselves on opposite sides of a railroad crossing dispute. They disagree about what standard of conduct should define the obligations of a driver who comes to an unguarded railroad crossing. Holmes offers a rule: The driver must stop and look. Cardozo rejects the rule and instead offers a standard: The driver must act with reasonable caution. Which is the preferable approach? Holmes suggests that the requirements of due care at railroad crossings are clear and, therefore, it is appropriate to crystallize these obligations into a simple rule of law. Cardozo counters with scenarios in which it would be neither wise nor prudent for a driver to stop and look. Holmes might well have answered that Cardozo’s scenarios are exceptions and that exceptions prove the rule. Indeed, Holmes might have parried by suggesting that the definition of a standard of conduct by means of a legal rule is predictable and certain, whereas standards and juries are not. This dispute could go on for quite some time.

AB  - In judging the quality of a research study it is very important to consider threats to the validity of the study and the results. This is particularly important for empirical research where there is often a multitude of possible threats. With a growing focus on empirical research methods in software engineering it is important that there is a consensus in the community on this importance, that validity analysis is done by every researcher and that there is common terminology and support on how to do and report it. Even though there are previous relevant results they have primarily focused on quantitative research methods and in particular experiments. Here we look at the existing advice and guidelines and then perform a review of 43 papers published in the ESEM conference in 2009 and analyse the validity analysis they include and which threats and strategies for overcoming them that were given by the authors. Based on this analysis we then discuss what is working well and less well in validity analysis of empirical software engineering research and present recommendations on how to better support validity analysis in the future.

Somehow they had internalized this household brand name without ever analyzing it into its component parts. It was as if the name of the product had taken on a life of its own, and required no more reference back to its ‘meaning’ than do words of foreign origin such as  chop suey  (‘mixed bits’) and  spaghetti  (‘little cords’). But how could this come about in the case of a name which, although oddly spelled, so transparently refers to crisp rice? In actual fact, overlooking the internal composition of names is a far more common phenomenon than we might at first think.

AB  - In this paper we introduce examination dialogues, an addition to the dialogue typology of Walton and Krabbe. In educational settings the purpose of dialogue is often to elicit the position of a student, e.g. to test understanding. In other settings, a frequently adopted tactic is to attack an opponent's stance by exposing internal inconsistencies in their argument. In real debate such inconsistencies will often be rather more subtle than elementary logical fallacies since they arise from contradictions apparent in the opponent's value system. Protagonists will be better positioned to judge the applicability of this tactic as more information is determined concerning the exact nature of their opponent's case, e.g. the arguments favoured and values endorsed. One obstacle, however, is that following a request to state a view, the challenged party may refuse to comment. In this paper we present an approach to modelling the evolution of examination dialogues based on the concept of value-based argument frameworks and outline some algorithmic issues regarding argument selection.

AB  - 1 The paper is a revised version of the paper entitled "The impact of stakeholders’ geographical distribution on managing requirements in a multi-site organization” published in the Proceedings of the IEEE Int’l Conference on Requirements Engineering, 2002 Abstract The increasing globalization of software industry demands an investigation of Requirements Engineering (RE) in multi-site software development organizations. Requirements engineering is a task difficult enough when done locally -but it is even more difficult when cross-functional stakeholder groups specify requirements across cultural, language and time zone boundaries. This paper reports on a field study that investigated RE challenges introduced by stakeholders’ geographical distribution in a multi-site organization. The goal was to examine RE practice in global software development, to formulate recommendations for improvement as well as to provide directions for future research on methods and tools. Based on the empirical evidence, we have constructed a model of how remote communication and knowledge management, cultural diversity and time differences negatively impact on requirements gathering, negotiation and specification. Findings reveal that aspects such as a lack of a common understanding of requirements, together with reduced awareness of working local context, trust level and ability to share work artifacts significantly challenge the effective collaboration of remote stakeholders in negotiating a set of requirements that satisfies geographically distributed customers. The paper concludes with recommendations for improving RE practice in this setting.

AB  - Goal models have proven useful for capturing, understanding, and communicating requirements during early stages of software development. However, the utility of goal models is greatly enhanced when they can be exploited during downstream stages of the requirements analysis process (e.g. requirements elaboration, validation, planning), and can be used as part of the entire system life cycle (e.g., architectural and behavioral process design, coding, testing, monitoring, adaptation, and evolution). In order to better understand the progress that has been made in integrating goal models with downstream system development, the authors ask: what approaches exist that map/integrate/transform goal models to later stage software artifacts? To answer this question, they conduct a systematic survey, producing a roadmap of work summarizing 243 publications. Results include a categorization of the â€œwhy?â€ and â€œhow?â€ for each approach. Furthermore, they select the 50 most prominent publications, based on citation numbers, in order to perform an in-depth literature review. Findings show that there is a wide variety of proposals with a variety of proposed goal models and targets, covering multiple paradigms, motivated by a variety of purposes. The authors conclude that although much work has been done in this area, the work is fragmented, following multiple separate strands of goal-orientation, and is often still in early stages of maturity.

Selecting appropriate values is however often difficult, especially when groups of stakeholders are involved. This paper identifies and compares generic and domain-specific group decision approaches for selecting quantitative values in goal models. It then reports on the use of two approaches targeting quantitative contributions, actor importance, and indicator definitions in the Goal-oriented Requirement Language. The approaches have been deployed in two independent branches of the Canadian government.

AB  - Abstract Argumentation Frameworks afs provide a fruitful basis for exploring issues of defeasible reasoning. Their power largely derives from the abstract nature of the arguments within the framework, where arguments are atomic nodes in an undifferentiated relation of attack. This abstraction conceals different conceptions of argument, and concrete instantiations encounter difficulties as a result of conflating these conceptions. We distinguish three distinct senses of the term. We provide an approach to instantiating AF in which the nodes are restricted to literals and rules, encoding the underlying theory directly. Arguments, in each of the three senses, then emerge from this framework as distinctive structures of nodes and paths. Our framework retains the theoretical and computational benefits of an abstract af, while keeping notions distinct which are conflated in other approaches to instantiation.

AB  - The problem of regulatory compliance for a software system consists of ensuring through a systematic, tool-supported process that the system complies with all elements of a relevant law. To deal with the problem, we build a model of the law and contrast it with a model of the requirements of the system. In earlier work, we proposed a modelling language for law (Nomos 2) along with a reasoning mechanism that answers questions about compliance. In this paper we extend Nomos 2 to include the concepts of role and requirement so that we can reason about compliance in specific domains. Also, Nomos 3 represents the distribution of responsibilities to roles, distinguishing social from legal roles. Nomos 3 models allow us to reason about compliance of requirements and roles with the norms that constitute a law. A small case study is used to illustrate the elements of Nomos 3 and the kinds of reasoning it supports.

AB  - Rules perform a moral function by restating moral principles in concrete terms, so as to reduce the uncertainty, error, and controversy that result when individuals follow their own unconstrained moral judgment. Although reason dictates that we must follow rules to avoid destructive error and controversy, rules—and hence laws—are imperfect, and reason also dictates that we ought not follow them when we believe they produce the wrong result in a particular case. In The Rule of Rules Larry Alexander and Emily Sherwin examine this dilemma.

Once the importance of this moral and practical conflict is acknowledged, the authors argue, authoritative rules become the central problems of jurisprudence. The inevitable gap between rules and background morality cannot be bridged, they claim, although many contemporary jurisprudential schools of thought are misguided attempts to do so. Alexander and Sherwin work through this dilemma, which lies at the heart of such ongoing jurisprudential controversies as how judges should reason in deciding cases, what effect should be given to legal precedent, and what status, if any, should be accorded to “legal principles.” In the end, their rigorous discussion sheds light on such topics as the nature of interpretation, the ancient dispute among legal theorists over natural law versus positivism, the obligation to obey law, constitutionalism, and the relation between law and coercion.

Those interested in jurisprudence, legal theory, and political philosophy will benefit from the edifying discussion in The Rule of Rules.

AB  - Goal models can capture the essence of legal and regulation statements and many of their relationships, enabling compliance analysis. However, current goal modeling approaches do not scale well when handling large regulations with many variable parts that depend on different aspects of regulated organizations. In this paper, we propose a tool-supported approach that integrates the Goal-oriented Requirement Language and feature modeling to handle regulatory goal model families. We show how they can be organized as a Software Product Line (SPL), ensuring the consistency of the SPL as a whole, and providing an adapted derivation process associated to a feature model configuration. The proposed approach is also evaluated on large generated SPLs with results suggesting its capability to address scalability concerns.

AB  - To address recent calls for better regulatory compliance of business processes (electronic or not), this study synthesizes research findings of nine peer-reviewed systematic literature reviews and state-of-the-art studies on business process compliance to examine Information Technology artifacts used in the compliance of business processes to laws and regulations. Results from the 342 unique studies covered by these reviews demonstrate that eight types of Information Technology artifacts are used in the design, execution and after-execution lifecycle phases of regulatory compliance to perform compliance modeling, checking, analysis and enactment tasks. The results also demonstrate with statistical evidence that compliance enactment (which involves putting mechanisms in place to address changes in the compliance representations, business processes or regulatory requirements) has received the least attention. This is a worrisome situation given the dynamic environment in which businesses operate. We argue that the findings in this work are relevant toward understanding the current state of the domain, providing insights on what phases and tasks need improvement.

AB  - The paper describes work on a current collaborative research project involving UK Universities and the Scottish Office's Building Directorate. Previous work by the Directorate had identified limitations in a conventional expert systems approach to the development and management of building Standards information. Work in the current project seeks to overcome these limitations by combining representational paradigms. In particular, a system is being designed and implemented which is based on and seeks to extend the concept of Headed Record Expertext (Diaper 90) in which formalised information can be attached, where appropriate, to nodes in a hypertext version of the Standards. The systemalso handles navigation rules and provides intelligent guidance for the reader through the hyperdocument. The underlying node/arc representational structure is also intended to support the capture of argumentation material generated during the development, maintenance and use ofStandardsinformation.

AB  - In this chapter we will draw upon insights from computational approaches and argumentation theories to create a framework for the rational reconstruction of legal argument. Taking the perspective of a lawyer we develop a conceptual model intended to accommodate all stages involved in legal argument. We then relate Argumentation Theory and work in AI and Law to this conceptual model. We conclude by considering the scope for the two disciplines learning from one another, and by drawing attention to areas that we believe offer fruitful opportunities for inter-disciplinary research.

AB  - In these years, many laws and regulations are being enacted to prevent business processes (BPs) and information systems (ISs) from their malicious users. As a result, it is significant for organizations to ensure that their BPs and ISs comply with these regulations. This paper proposes a technique to apply a formal technique to ensure the regulatory compliance of BP or IS descriptions written in use case models. We translate the use case models of the behavior of BPs and ISs into finite state transition machines. Regulations are represented with computational tree logic (CTL) and their satisfiability are automatically verified using a model checker SMV. The modality of regulations can be specified with temporal operators based on branching time semantics of the CTL in our technique.

AB  - This paper describes the possibilities of the translation of legislation, which is written in natural language, into a formal language, i.e. UML/OCL. The tool OPAL (Object-oriented Parsing and Analysis of Legislation) is developed to support the automatic modelling of legislation with the use of appropriate NLP techniques. The aim is not to perform this modelling in a batch fashion from legislation to final model, but interactively in dialogue with the knowledge engineer. The main components of OPAL are a parser (based on a chart-parser algorithm) and a model generator. A special component called modelling interface is added to OPAL to give the knowledge engineer the possibility to keep track of the modelling process and to make adjustments to the final model.

AB  - In this paper we introduce dialectical frameworks, a powerful generalization of Dung-style argumentation frameworks where each node comes with an associated acceptance condition. This allows us to model different types of dependencies, e.g. support and attack, as well as different types of nodes within a single framework. We show that Dung's standard semantics can be generalized to dialectical frameworks, in case of stable and preferred semantics to a slightly restricted class which we call bipolar frameworks. We show how acceptance conditions can be conveniently represented using weights respectively priorities on the links and demonstrate how some of the legal proof standards can be modeled based on this idea.

AB  - During the past two decades many research teams have worked on the enhancement of the explanation capabilities of knowledge-based systems and decision support systems. During the same period, other researchers have worked on the development of argumentative techniques for software systems. We think that it would be interesting for the researchers belonging to these different communities to share their experiences and to develop systems that take advantage of the advances gained in each domain.

We start by reviewing the evolution of explanation systems from the simple reasoning traces associated with early expert systems to recent research on interactive and collaborative explanations. We then discuss the characteristics of critiquing systems that test the credibility of the user's solution. The rest of the paper deals with the different application domains that use argumentative techniques. First, we discuss how argumentative reasoning can be captured by a general structure in which a given claim or conclusion is inferred from a set of data and how this argument structure relates to pragmatic knowledge, explanation production and practical reasoning. We discuss the role of argument in defeasible reasoning and present some works in the new field of computer-mediated defeasible argumentation. We review different application domains such as computer-mediated communication, design rationale, crisis management and knowledge management, in which argumentation support tools are used. We describe models in which arguments are associated to mental attitudes such as goals, plans and beliefs. We present recent advances in the application of argumentative techniques to multi-agent systems. Finally, we propose research perspectives for the integration of explanation and argumentation capabilities in knowledge-based systems and make suggestions for enhancing the argumentation and persuasion capabilities of software agents.

AB  - The increasing development of legal ontologies seems to offer interesting solutions to legal knowledge formalization, which in past experiences lead to a limited exploitation of legal expert systems for practical use. The paper describes how a constructive approach to ontology can provide useful components to create newly designed legal decision support systems either as local or Web-based semantic services. We describe the relation of our research to AI&Law and legal philosophy, the components of our Core Legal Ontology, the JurWordNet semantic lexicon, and some examples of use of legal ontologies for both norm conformity and compatibility. Our legal ontologies are based on DOLCE+, an extension of the DOLCE foundational ontology developed in the WonderWeb and Metokis EU projects.

This application shows how to develop adaptive agents with a goal driven design and a decision process built on a CBR architecture. The resulting agent architecture has been validated by real users who have used the tourist guide application, on a mobile device, and can be generalized for the development of other personalized services.

AB  - There exist two broad approaches to information retrieval (IR) in the legal domain: those based on manual knowledge engineering (KE) and those based on natural language processing (NLP). The KE approach is grounded in artificial intelligence (AI) and case-based reasoning (CBR), whilst the NLP approach is associated with open domain statistical retrieval. We provide some original arguments regarding the focus on KE-based retrieval in the past and why this is not sustainable in the long term. Legal approaches to questioning (NLP), rather than arguing (CBR), are proposed as the appropriate jurisprudential and cognitive underpinning for legal IR. Recall within the context of precision is proposed as a better fit to law than the 'total recall' model of the past, wherein conceptual and contextual search are combined to improve retrieval performance for both parties in a dispute.

While it is not unreasonable to be surprised by a black swan, to be surprised by subsequent cases that are similar enough that they might cause the same sort of upheaval is unforgivable. The problem is how to reason about these almost novel, not totally unforeseen, subsequent cases that I call gray cygnets.

AB  - Usability is considered as a very significant factor towards the wide acceptance of software applications. Although the usability evaluation can take place in different forms, the entire evaluation procedure usually follows predefined ways according to a classification of the common characteristics of software applications. However, contemporary Web 2.0 applications, which aim at both social network development and collaboration support, reveal the need for modifying the settings of the evaluation procedure. This is due to some unique characteristics of these applications, such as the support of both synchronous and asynchronous collaboration, the use of common spaces for working and information exchanging, and the advanced notification and awareness services. This paper explores these applications’ particularities with respect to the way the whole usability evaluation procedure is affected and proposes a composite evaluation technique based on the development of appropriate heuristics that is suitable for such cases. The aforementioned issues are elaborated through the case of CoPe_it!, a Web 2.0 tool that facilitates and enhances argumentative collaboration.

AB  - This paper studies the logical modelling of presumptions and their effects on the burden of proof. Presumptions are modelled as default rules and their effect on the burden of proof is defined in terms of a distinction between the burden of production, the burden of persuasion and the tactical burden of proof. These notions are logically characterised in such a way that presumptions enable a party to fulfil a burden of production or persuasion while shifting a tactical burden to the other party. Finally, it is shown how debates about what can be presumed can be modelled as debates about the backings of default rules.

AB  - Historically, business process design has been driven by business objectives, specifically process improvement. However this cannot come at the price of control objectives which stem from various legislative, standard and business partnership sources. Ensuring the compliance to regulations and industrial standards is an increasingly important issue in the design of business processes. In this paper, we advocate that control objectives should be addressed at an early stage, i.e., design time, so as to minimize the problems of runtime compliance checking and consequent violations and penalties. To this aim, we propose supporting mechanisms for business process designers. This paper specifically presents a support method which allows the process designer to quantitatively measure the compliance degree of a given process model against a set of control objectives. This will allow process designers to comparatively assess the compliance degree of their design as well as be better informed on the cost of non-compliance.

AB  - Case-based reasoning is one of the fastest growing areas in the field of knowledge-based systems and this book, authored by a leader in the field, is the first comprehensive text on the subject. Case-based reasoning systems are systems that store information about situations in their memory. As new problems arise, similar situations are searched out to help solve these problems. Problems are understood and inferences are made by finding the closest cases in memory, comparing and contrasting the problem with those cases, making inferences based on those comparisons, and asking questions when inferences can't be made. This book presents the state of the art in case-based reasoning. The author synthesizes and analyzes a broad range of approaches, with special emphasis on applying case-based reasoning to complex real-world problem-solving tasks such as medical diagnosis, design, conflict resolution, and planning. The author's approach combines cognitive science and engineering, and is based on analysis of both expert and common-sense tasks. Guidelines for building case-based expert systems are provided, such as how to represent knowledge in cases, how to index cases for accessibility, how to implement retrieval processes for efficiency, and how to adapt old solutions to fit new situations. This book is an excellent text for courses and tutorials on case-based reasoning. It is also a useful resource for computer professionals and cognitive scientists interested in learning more about this fast-growing field.

PY  - 2000
AB  - After years of Congressional debates and agency rule-making, the HIPAA health care privacy rule has finally become effective. Why did it take so long? Many of the issues which deadlocked Congressional attempts to pass federal privacy legislation reflect deep disagreements over how much individual privacy should be protected. On one hand, patients often believe that no one except their closest health caregivers should be able to see their medical records without their permission. On the other hand, many other people and entities, mostly strangers to the patient, believe they should have access to those records without having to ask permission. They argue that such relatively free access to individual health care information is good for the patient, good for other patients, and good for society - in other words, that too much privacy protection is bad for our individual and collective health. Indeed, society has often tolerated sacrifices in individual medical privacy in order to promote the public good. This article examines the ethical trade-offs that we have made between the benefits of privacy protection and the benefits of sacrificing it in the name of social welfare, such as advances in scientific research, protection of the public health, higher efficiency and better quality in the delivery of health care, and even improved law enforcement. It analyzes how these ethical trade-offs have been reflected in our laws, Congressional debates, and recent HIPAA privacy rule. It also examines several key issues which created the impasse in enacting comprehensive federal legislation, and which continue to be controversial as providers face the task of compliance. The article serves as a guide for legal and health care professionals who would like to be introduced to what the controversy over health care privacy has been all about and how the HIPAA rule has, at least for the time being, resolved some aspects of it.

AB  - The Regnet Project aims to develop a formal information infrastructure for regulatory information management and compliance assistance. This paper discusses three basic milestones of current research and development efforts. The first is the creation of a document repository containing federal and state regulations and supplemental documents. This repository includes a suite of concept hierarchies that enable users to browse documents according to the terms they contain. The second is an XML framework for representing regulations and associated metadata. The XML framework enables the augmentation of regulation text with tools and information that will help users understand and comply with the regulation. The third milestone is the creation of a compliance assistance system built upon the XML framework. The prototype effort for the document repository has been focused on environmental regulations and related documents. The compliance assistance system is illustrated in the domain of used oil management.

The FEAST project recently initiated (see sections 4–6 below) is expected to throw additional light on the phenomenology underlying these laws, to increase understanding of them, to explore their finer detail, to expose their wider relevance and implications and to develop means for their beneficial exploitation. This paper is intended to trigger wider interest in the laws and in the FEAST study of feedback and feedback control in the context of the software process and its improvement to ensure beneficial exploitation of their potential.

We first define a formal and conceptually rich language able to represent, and reason about, chains of reparational obligations of various types. Second, we devise a mechanism for normalising a system of legal norms. Third, we specify a suitable language for business process modeling able to automate and optimise business procedures and to embed normative constraints. Fourth, we develop an algorithm for compliance checking and discuss some computational issues regarding the possibility of checking compliance runtime or of enforcing it at design time.

AB  - This paper presents a technique to check the compliance of requirements with regulations while eliciting requirements. In our technique, we semantically represent a regulation with combinations of case frames resulting from Case Grammar technique. We match a newly elicited requirement sentence with the case frames of regulation sentences and then check if the requirements include the obligation acts specified by the matched regulation sentences and if they do not have prohibited acts. If we find that a requirement sentence does not follow the regulation, the addition or removal of the illegal acts included in the requirements are suggested.

AB  - In this paper we describe an approach to classifying objects in a domain where classifications are uncertain using a novel combination of argumentation and data mining. Classification is the topic of a dialogue game between two agents, based on an argument scheme and critical questions designed for use by agents whose knowledge of the domain comes from data mining. Each agent has its own set of examples which it can mine to find arguments based on association rules for and against a classification of a new instance. These arguments are exchanged in order to classify the instance. We describe the dialogue game, and in particular discuss the strategic considerations which agents can use to select their moves. Different strategies give rise to games with different characteristics, some having the flavour of persuasion dialogues and other deliberation dialogues.

AB  - Business process compliance management has recently grabbed a lot of attention in both business and academia as it helps organizations not only to control and monitor their business processes from a legal point of view but also to avoid financial penalties and undesirable consequences to their reputation. Balancing compliance obligations with business objectives remains however a difficult challenge. We believe goal-oriented compliance management using Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to measure the compliance level of organizations is an area that can be further developed to tackle this challenge. Goaloriented compliance management concepts have been explored before. However, there is little research on how to measure and improve the compliance level of organizations using KPIs while considering the impact of candidate adjustments on business goals. We discuss a proposal toward a framework to address the aforementioned problems.

AB  - In the traditional definition of Dung's abstract argumentation framework ($\ensuremath{AF}$), the notion of attack is understood as a relation between arguments, thus bounding attacks to start from and be directed to arguments. This paper introduces a generalized definition of abstract argumentation framework called $\ensuremath{AFRA}$ (Argumentation Framework with Recursive Attacks), where an attack is allowed to be directed towards another attack. From a conceptual point of view, we claim that this generalization supports a straightforward representation of reasoning situations which are not easily accommodated within the traditional framework. From the technical side, we first investigate the extension to the generalized framework of the basic notions of conflict-free set, acceptable argument, admissible set and of Dung's fundamental lemma. Then we propose a correspondence from the $\ensuremath{AFRA}$ to the $\ensuremath{AF}$ formalism, showing that it satisfies some basic desirable properties. Finally we analyze the relationships between $\ensuremath{AFRA}$ and a similar extension of Dung's abstract argumentation framework, called $\ensuremath{EAF+}$ and derived from the recently proposed formalism $\ensuremath{EAF}$.

AB  - The Pleadings Game is a major contribution to artificial intelligence and legal theory. The book draws on jurisprudence and moral philosophy to develop a formal model of argumentation called the pleadings game. From a technical perspective, the work can be viewed as an extension of recent argumentation-based approaches to non-monotonic logic: (1) the game is dialogical rather than mono-logical; (2) the validity and priority of defeasible rules is subject to debate; and (3) resource limitations are acknowledged by rules for fairly dividing the burdens of representation and proof among the players. Gordon's work evaluates important jurisprudential theories of argumentation and reasoning in the context of the U.S. commercial law on secured transactions. Audience: It is not necessary to have a formal background in law to appreciate The Pleadings Game. It will be of equal interest to both the artificial intelligence community and legal theorists.

AB  - Machine readable open public data and the issue of multilingual web are open challenges promising to transform the relationship between citizens and European institutions. In this context the DA- LOS1 project aims at ensuring coherence and alignment in the legislative language, providing law-makers with knowledge management tools to improve the control over the multilingual complexity of European legislation and over the linguistic and conceptual issues involved in its transposition into national laws. This paper describes the design and implementation activities performed on the basis of a set of parallel texts in different languages on a specific legal topic. Natural language processing techniques have been applied to automatically build lexicons for each language. Lexical and conceptual multilingual alignment has been accomplished exploiting terms position in parallel documents. An ontology describing entities involved in the chosen domain has been developed in order to provide a semantic description of terms in lexicons. A modular integration of such resources, represented in RDF/OWL standard format, allowed their effective and flexible access from a legislative drafting application prototype, able to enrich legal documents with terms mark-up and semantic annotations.

We present three novel results: We develop a theory for argumentation in which the acceptability of arguments is precisely defined. We show that logic programming and nonmonotonic reasoning in AI are different forms of argumentation. We show that argumentation can be viewed as a special form of logic programming with negation as failure.

This result introduces a general method for generating metainterpreters for argumentation systems.

AB  - Agile methodologies such as XP and Scrum are founded upon the four values and twelve principles of agile software development. A software development project is only considered to be truly agile if these values and principles are followed. However, software developed for use in medical devices must be regulatory compliant and this can make the process of following a single agile methodology such as XP difficult to achieve. This paper outlines how we identified the barriers to agile adoption in the medical device software domain through performing a survey. These barriers include: lack of documentation; maintaining traceability; regulatory compliance; lack of up front planning and the process of managing multiple releases. Based on this research recommendations are also made as to how these barriers can be overcome.

Legal interpretation is a mechanism from law allowing norms to be adapted to unforeseen situations. We model this mechanism for norms regulating computer systems by representing the purpose of norms by social goals and by revising the constitutive rules defining the applicability of norms. We illustrate the interpretation mechanism by examples.

AB  - Regulations are a wide-spread and important part of government and business. They codify how products must be made and processes should be performed. Such regulations can be difficult to understand and apply. In an environment of growing complexity of, and change in, regulation, automated support for reasoning with regulations is becoming increasingly necessary. In this paper we report on ongoing work which aims at providing automated support for the drafting and use of regulations using logic modelling techniques. We highlight the support that can be provided by logic modelling, describe the technical foundation of our project, and report on the status of the project and the next steps.

AB  - Existing models for describing a process (such as a business process or a software development process) tend to focus on the "what" or the "how" of the process. For example, a health insurance claim process would typically be described in terms of a number of steps for assessing and approving a claim. In trying to improve or redesign a process, however, one also needs to have an understanding of the "why"--for example, why do physicians submit treatment plans to insurance companies before giving treatment? and why do claims managers seek medical opinions when assessing treatment plans? An understanding of the motivations and interests of process participants is often crucial to the successful redesign of processes.
This thesis proposes a modelling framework i* (pronounced i-star) consisting of two modelling components. The Strategic Dependency (SD) model describes a process in terms of intentional dependency relationships among agents. Agents depended on each other for goals to be achieved, tasks to be performed, and resources to be furnished. Agents are intentional in that they have desires and wants, and strategic in that they are concerned about opportunities and vulnerabilities. The Strategic Rationale (SR) model describes the issues and concerns that agents have about existing processes and proposed alternatives, and how they might be addressed, in terms of a network of means-ends relationships. An agent's routines for carrying out a process can be analyzed for their ability, workability, viability and believability. Means-ends rules are used to suggest methods for addressing issues, related issues to be raised, and assumptions to be challenged. The models are represented in the conceptual modelling language Telos. The modelling concepts are axiomatically characterized.
The utility of the framework is illustrated each of four application areas: requirements engineering, business process reengineering, organizational impacts analysis, and software process modelling. Advantage of i* over existing modelling techniques in each of these areas are described.

AB  - Criminal investigation is a difficult and laborious process that is prone to error as teams of investigators may be subject to tunnel vision, groupthink, and confirmation bias. As a result, miscarriages of justice may ensue. To overcome these problems, in the Dutch law enforcement organization, crime analysts have been given a more important role. It is now their task to critically evaluate the investigation that is going on. They have to make sense of the vast amount of evidence available in a case by generating plausible scenarios about what might have happened. Subsequently, they have to assess the quality of their scenarios and choose the best alternative. Due to the difficulty of this process, a great need exists for software that supports crime analysts in their task. However, current support tools for crime analysis do not allow analysts to record scenarios and their relation to the evidence and as a result the most important part of the analysis process remains in the analysts' minds. Therefore, they may benefit from so-called sensemaking systems that allow them to make their reasoning process explicit by visualizing scenarios and the reasons why these scenarios are supported by the evidence. Nevertheless, such sensemaking tools for crime analysis are relatively sparse and often do not incorporate a logical model of reasoning with evidence in the context of crime analysis. This thesis aims to fill this gap by proposing sensemaking software that has specifically been designed for crime analysis. Such a tool should be rationally well-founded, natural, useful, usable, and effective. To this aid, a proof-of-concept application called AVERs (Argument Visualization for Evidential Reasoning based on stories) was built that implements a rationally well-founded and natural model of the reasoning that takes place in crime analysis. In this way a standard of rational reasoning is encouraged and errors may be reduced. Using AVERs analysts are able to create visual representations of scenarios and evidential arguments. Scenarios are represented as causal networks of events, while evidential arguments are arguments based on the evidential data in the case. Such arguments are based on argumentation schemes that often come with critical questions. These questions make the analysts more aware of possible sources of doubt and encourage them to critically examine the evidence. Evidential arguments can be used to support or attack scenarios with the available evidence. In this way, this software allows the analysts to reason about scenarios and to critically evaluate them. Moreover, it provides features that can be used to compare alternative scenarios. A series of empirical studies has confirmed that the design and implementation of AVERs fulfills all five criteria to a certain degree. This means that it is useful to crime analysts and satisfies their desires, while it may improve their analysis of the case and the communication of their results to the investigators working on the case, and ensures that rational analyses are performed. Therefore, through this software in the future biases in the crime analysis process may be avoided.

AB  - This article presents a methodology for multilingual legal knowledge acquisition and modelling. It encompasses two comlementary strategies. On the one hand, there is the top–down definition of the conceptual structure of the legal domain under consideration on the basis of expert jugdment. This structure is language–independent, modeled as an ontology, and can be aligned with other ontologies that capture similar or complementary knowledge, in order to provide a wider conceptual embedding. Another top–down approach is the exploitation of the explicit structure of legal texts, which enables the targeted identification of text spans that play an ontological role and their subsequent inclusion in the knowledge model.

On the other hand, the linguistically motivated, text-based bottom–up population and incremental refinement of this conceptual structure using (semi-)automatic NLP techniques, maximizes the completeness and domain-specificity of the resulting knowledge.

The proposed methodology is concerned with the relation between these two differently derived types of knowledge, and defines a framework for interfacing lexical and ontological knowledge, the result of which offers various perspectives on multilingual legal knowledge.

Two case-studies combining bottom-up and top-down methodologies for knowledge modelling and learning are presented as illustrations of the methodology.

This paper gives an overview of two XML standard proposals dealing with two complementary aspects of electronic legislation --- the documents themselves as a carrier, and an institutional reality they represent --- in a coherent way: MetaLex XML and the Legal Knowledge Interchange format (LKIF). MetaLex XML is well on its way to becoming formal and de facto standard for legislation in XML. LKIF is yet to be submitted as a proposed standard. LKIF includes some interesting innovations from an AI & Law perspective.

AB  - Requirements volatility is considered to be a major source of risk to the management of large and complex software projects. The ability to characterise the nature and origins of requirements change during software development is important and can lead organisations towards more effective management of changing requirements. This work focuses on a study to establish how practitioners classify requirements change requests. We used the card sorting method to identify categories of change requests that software developers use in practice. Card sorting is a knowledge elicitation method that is commonly used for capturing information about different ways of representing domain knowledge. This study has allowed us to get valuable insights into the way practitioners classify change requests and to understand their perspectives on classification. This classification is a valuable source of information in prioritizing change requests and assessing their impact. Our findings from the card sorting exercise further reveal that the criteria used for categorization are related to the role the practitioner plays in the software development team and the nature and extent of their responsibilities.

AB  - Argument-based formalisms are gaining popularity as models of non-monotonic reasoning. Central in such formalisms is a notion of argument. Arguments are formal reconstructions of how a conclusion is supported. Generally, an argument is defeasible. This means that an argument supporting a conclusion does not always justify its conclusion: the argument can be defeated. Whether a conclusion supported by an argument is justified depends on the structure of the argument and on the other arguments available.

Moreover, present approaches to the development of legal knowledge-based systems (LKBS) - such as the use of rule-based systems, case-based systems, or logics - have obtained somewhat limited theoretical and practical results. This book provides a critical overview of the field by describing present approaches and analysing their problems in detail. A new "modelling approach" to legal knowledge engineering is proposed to address these problems and provide an agenda for research and development. This approach applies recent developments in knowledge modelling to the law domain. The book's central premise, that the development of LK BS should be centred on the elaboration of explicit models of law, is well demonstrated, it is an extremely worthwhile read for anyone interested in the theoretical foundations of AI and law and knowledge representation in particular.

AB  - A self-contained treatment of fuzzy systems engineering, offering conceptual fundamentals, design methodologies, development guidelines, and carefully selected illustrative material Forty years have passed since the birth of fuzzy sets, in which time a wealth of theoretical developments, conceptual pursuits, algorithmic environments, and other applications have emerged. Now, this reader-friendly book presents an up-to-date approach to fuzzy systems engineering, covering concepts, design methodologies, and algorithms coupled with interpretation, analysis, and underlying engineering knowledge. The result is a holistic view of fuzzy sets as a fundamental component of computational intelligence and human-centric systems. Throughout the book, the authors emphasize the direct applicability and limitations of the concepts being discussed, and historical and bibliographical notes are included in each chapter to help readers view the developments of fuzzy sets from a broader perspective. A radical departure from current books on the subject, Fuzzy Systems Engineering presents fuzzy sets as an enabling technology whose impact, contributions, and methodology stretch far beyond any specific discipline, making it applicable to researchers and practitioners in engineering, computer science, business, medicine, bioinformatics, and computational biology. Additionally, three appendices and classroom-ready electronic resources make it an ideal textbook for advanced undergraduate- and graduate-level courses in engineering and science.

AB  - In an age of shrinking development cycles, it is harder than ever to bring the right product to market at the right time. Good product, especially complex products, is underpinned by good systems, and systems engineering itself is recognised as the key tool to product development. This book covers the principles of systems design in an easy to read format. The authors have decades of practical industrial experience, and the material is ideal for industrial project teams. For academic courses, the book acts as a component for graduate and undergraduate engineering studies, particularly those on systems engineering. It covers how to handle requirements, architectural design, integration and verification, starting from the perspective of a simple linear lifecycle. The book then gradually introduces recent work on the complexity of real world systems, with issues such as multi-level systems, and iterative development. There is also coverage of the impact of systems engineering at the organsational level.

AB  - This paper analyzes the phenomenon of a shift of the burden of proof in persuasion dialogues in which arguments are constructed according to argumentation schemes. Some sample di- alogues are analyzed with arguments from expert opinion, revealing that some critical questions of this scheme carry with them a burden of proof on the questioner while others do not, and that the burden of proof can become the subject of debate during a dialogue. Then these dialogues are diagrammed with the argument visualization software Araucaria, and a simple formal protocol is proposed of persuasion dialogues with embedded burden-of-proof dialogues. The objective of this paper is to analyze the phenomenon of a shift of the burden of proof in persuasion dialogues where arguments are constructed according to argumentation schemes. Suppose an argu- ment instantiating some scheme has been put forward and a criti- cal question matching the scheme for that argument has been asked. Does merely asking the question make the argument default, or is the burden on the questioner to provide evidence? In this paper we take the view that the answer to this question depends on domain-specific issues and that the domain context in which the dialogue takes place will often leave room for disagreement on allocations of the burden of proof. Accordingly, our aim is to present a protocol for two-person persuasion dialogues in which the burden of proof can become the issue under dispute. In developing our model, we will first analyze some sample dialogues using the argumentation scheme from expert opinion, then semiformally diagram these dialogues with the argu- ment visualization software Araucaria (10), and finally present a for- mal protocol. The protocol will be simple, intended to give a first idea of how protocols for burden-of-proof dialogues can be formalized. As for previous research, most dialogue systems for persuasion

AB  - Mandatory data breach notification has become a matter of increasing concern for law reformers. In Australia, this issue was recently addressed as part of a comprehensive review of privacy law conducted by the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) which recommended a uniform national regime for protecting personal information applicable to both the public and private sectors. As in all federal systems, the distribution of powers between central and state governments poses problems for national consistency. In the authors’ view, a uniform approach to mandatory data breach notification has greater merit than a ‘jurisdiction specific’ approach epitomized by US state-based laws. The US response has given rise to unnecessary overlaps and inefficiencies as demonstrated by a review of different notification triggers and encryption safe harbors. Reviewing the US response, the authors conclude that a uniform approach to data breach notification is inherently more efficient.

AB  - One basic requirement for a functional safety development project is to establish a SIL-compliant safety lifecycle model. For a company with a big family of safety-related products and a great number of development projects like ABB, it would be very time-consuming and cost-intensive for each safety development project to develop a safety lifecycle model. One approach for managing the corresponding costs and effort is to create a common lifecycle model that fulfills the SIL requirements and can be reused by safety-related projects. In this paper we are going to present such a common safety lifecycle model, its structure and components, and our experience on how to establish and apply it in safety-related product development projects. The paper analyzes the design constraints for the development of a common safety lifecycle model such as complexity, flexibility, simplicity, conformity and the safety integrity. It shows how these constraints drive the design of the safety lifecycle model to be developed. Our design concept, design considerations, development strategy, and our experience in establishing such a common safety lifecycle model will also be discussed in the paper.

AB  - This book examines in some detail how our concepts of an ideal or "universal" audience influence legal argument. It shows how asking what are the arguments and what are the forms of argumentation that we believe would be accepted by such an audience is a useful analytical tool. The book explores what, if any, are the constraints that our vision of an ideal audience imposes on public discourse and particularly on legal discourse. Some visions of an ideal or universal audience are widely shared; others are only shared within particular political and legal cultures. Stylistic preferences can have as important an influence on legal decision making as do substantive preferences. In some cultures and legal systems there is a preference for resort to broad general principles; in others there is a preference for a more circumscribed and particular mode of legal argument. Different legal cultures have different idealized notions as to the role of the judge and these different conceptions of the role of the judge will influence many aspects of legal decision making, including how statutes and other authoritative official instruments should be interpreted. The book also illustrates, by concrete examples, how the resolution of all these questions will be influenced by how a particular legal culture envisions the common or public good and by how tolerant a particular legal culture is of diverse outcomes, that is by how much discretion superior legal decision makers are prepared to grant inferior decision makers.

AB  - Information extraction from legal documents is an important and open problem. A mixed approach, using linguistic information and machine learning techniques, is described in this paper. In this approach, top-level legal concepts are identified and used for document classification using Support Vector Machines. Named entities, such as, locations, organizations, dates, and document references, are identified using semantic information from the output of a natural language parser. This information, legal concepts and named entities, may be used to populate a simple ontology, allowing the enrichment of documents and the creation of high-level legal information retrieval systems.

The proposed methodology was applied to a corpus of legal documents - from the EUR-Lex site – and it was evaluated. The obtained results were quite good and indicate this may be a promising approach to the legal information extraction problem.

AB  - In most expert systems, efforts are made to keep the rules in the knowledge base free from contradictions., because a logical system that generates even a single contradiction may collapse. We argue that not only can contradictions be tolerated, but in fact they are useful. An excellent test of an argument is to compare it with the best argument for the opposing view. Accordingly, we propose a multilevel architecture, where the object level may include contradictory rules, and the metalevels resolve these conflicts. Once such an architecture exists, there are advantages to allowing contradictions in wider contexts. In a legal context we may want to examine both sides of an argument. In administrative applications, we may need systems that ‘look over a clerk's shoulder’ to check that he is following one of several plausible, but not necessarily compatible, approaches. We are currently implementing these ideas.

PENG can be used in contexts where precise texts (e.g. software specifications, axioms for formal ontologies, legal documents) need to be composed. Texts written in PENG look seemingly informal and are easy to write and to read for humans but have first-order equivalent properties that make these texts computer-processable.

The paper gives an informal exposition of one particular way to deal with QCR, based on the author's previous work on reason-based logic (RBL). Then it contains a substantially adapted formalisation of RBL, to make RBL suitable for dealing with QCR. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of related work.

It is shown that the flexibility of thefeature-structure formalism can exploited to allow for structure-preservingrepresentations of non-primitive concepts, and to enable various types ofinteraction and cross-reference between language elements. A fragment of theDutch Opium Act is used to illustrate how modelling and reasoning proceed in practice.

AB  - A popular view of what Artificial Intelligence can do for lawyers is that it can do no more than deduce the consequences from a precisely stated set of facts and legal rules. This immediately makes many lawyers sceptical about the usefulness of such systems: this mechanical approach seems to leave out most of what is important in legal reasoning. A case does not appear as a set of facts, but rather as a story told by a client. For example, a man may come to his lawyer saying that he had developed an innovative product while working for Company A. Now Company B has made him an offer of a job, to develop a similar product for them. Can he do this? The lawyer firstly must interpret this story, in the context, so that it can be made to fit the framework of applicable law. Several interpretations may be possible. In our example it could be seen as being governed by his contract of employment, or as an issue in Trade Secrets law. Next the legal issues must be identified and the pros and cons of the various interpretations considered with respect to them. Does his contract include a non-disclosure agreement? If so, what are its terms? Was he the sole developer of the product? Did Company A support its development? Does the product use commonly known techniques? Did Company A take measures to protect the secret? Some of these will favour the client, some the Company. Each interpretation will require further facts to be obtained. For example, do the facts support a claim that the employee was the sole developer of the product? Was development work carried out in his spare time? What is the precise nature of the agreements entered into? Once an interpretation has been selected, the argument must be organised into the form considered most likely to persuade, both to advocate the client’s position and to rebut anticipated objections. Some precedents may point to one result and others to another. In that case, further arguments may be produced to suggest following the favourable precedent and ignoring the unfavourable one. Or the rhetorical presentation of the facts may prompt one interpretation rather than the other. Surely all this requires the skill, experience and judgement of a human being? Granted that this is true, much effort has been made to design computer programs that will help people in these tasks, and it is the purpose of this chapter to describe the progress that has been made in modelling and supporting this kind of sophisticated legal reasoning.We will review systems that can store conflicting interpretations and that can propose alternative solutions to a case based on these interpretations. We will also describe systems that can use legal precedents to generate arguments by drawing analogies to or distinguishing precedents. We will discuss systems that can argue why a rule should not be applied to a case even though all its conditions are met. Then there are systems that can act as a mediator between disputing parties by structuring and recording their arguments and responses. Finally we look at systems that suggest mechanisms and tactics for forming arguments.

AB  - The two different categories of legal AI system are described, and legal analysis systems are chosen as objects of study. So-called judgment machines are discussed, but it is decided that research in legal AI systems would be best carried-out in the area of legal expert systems. A model of legal reasoning is adopted, and two different methods of legal knowledge representation are examined: rule-based systems and case-based systems. It is argued that a rule-based approach to legal expert systems is inadequate given the requirements of lawyers and the nature of legal reasoning about cases. A new, eclectic approach is proposed, incorporating both rule-based and case-based knowledge representation. It is claimed that such an approach can form the basis of an effective and useful legal expert system.

He has been under intense pressure from various quarters, based on allegations that in previous positions of leadership he had not handled some sexual abuse incidents appropriately. In pondering what he should do, he must have been considering the many and varied arguments on both sides of the case. He must, in short, have been deliberating about his future.

PY  - 1997
AB  - We use the term requirements to denote what are often called functional requirements. Requirements are located in the environment, which is distinguished from the machine to be built. A requirement is a condition over phenomena of the environment. A specification is a restricted form of requirement, providing enough information for the implementer to build the machine (by programming it) without further environment knowledge. To describe requirements appropriately we must fit our descriptions into an appropriate structure. This structure must respect the distinction between the machine and the environment, and the distinction between those environment properties that are given (indicative descriptions) and those that must be achieved by the machine (optative descriptions). Formalisation is a fundamental problem of requirements engineering. Since most environments are parts of the physical world, and therefore informal, the formalisation task is inescapable. Some techniques are discussed for tackling this task. In particular, the use of designations is explained, and the distinction between definition and assertion. By using the smallest possible set of designated terms, augmented by appropriate definitions, the developer can create a narrow bridge between the environment and its descriptions in the requirements. In this way a sufficiently faithful approximation to the informal reality can be obtained.

System Requirements Engineering presents a balanced view of the issues, concepts, models, techniques and tools found in requirements engineering research and practice. Requirements engineering is presented from business, behavioural and software engineering perspectives and a general framework is established at the outset. This book considers requirements engineering as a combination of three concurrent and interacting processes: eliciting knowledge related to a problem domain, ensuring the validity of such knowledge and specifying the problem in a formal way. Particular emphasis is given to requirements elicitation techniques and there is a fully integrated treatment of the development of requirements specifications through enterprise modelling, functional requirements and non-functional requirements.

AB  - This paper builds on existing Goal Oriented Requirements Engineering (GORE) research by presenting a methodology with a supporting tool for analysing and demonstrating the alignment between software requirements and business objectives. Current GORE methodologies can be used to relate business goals to software goals through goal abstraction in goal graphs. However, we argue that unless the extent of goal-goal contribution is quantified with verifiable metrics and confidence levels, goal graphs are not sufficient for demonstrating the strategic alignment of software requirements. We introduce our methodology using an example software project from Rolls-Royce. We conclude that our methodology can improve requirements by making the relationships to business problems explicit, thereby disambiguating a requirement's underlying purpose and value.

AB  - As systems evolve their structure change in ways not expected upfront. As time goes by, the knowledge of the developers becomes more and more critical for the process of understanding the system. That is, when we want to understand a certain issue of the system we ask the knowledgeable developers. Yet, in large systems, not every developer is knowledgeable in all the details of the system. Thus, we would want to know which developer is knowledgeable in the issue at hand. In this paper we make use of the mapping between the changes and the author identifiers (e.g., user names) provided by versioning repositories. We first define a measurement for the notion of code ownership. We use this measurement to define the ownership map visualization to understand when and how different developers interacted in which way and in which part of the system. We report the results we obtained on several large systems.

AB  - The starting point of this article is the claim that logics for defeasible argumentation provide the means to logically characterise the difference between several kinds of proof burdens, but only if they are embedded in a dynamic setting that captures the various stages of a legal proceeding. It is also argued that estandardi argumentation logics for AI must be adapted in order to model shifts in burdens of proof. Thus this analysis illustrates in two ways that logics cannot be simply imposed on the law but that features of legal systems must be taken into account. First there is the claim that the burden of persuasion, which legally is the burden to prove a statement to a specified degree (the standard of proof) on the penalty of losing on the issue, can be verified by applying an argumentation logic to the evidence available at the final stage of a proceeding. Then a precise distinction is made between two burdens that are sometimes confused, namely the burden of production and the tactical burden. In this analysis, the tactical burden of proof is automatically induced by the defeasible nature of the reasoning. The burden of production, by contrast, concerns the legal question whether an issue can be submitted to trial or must be decided as a matter of law against the one who fails to produce any evidence. Finally the issue is raised to what extent this account can be generalised to statistical and story-based approaches.

AB  - The importance of candidate software requirements can vary by orders of magnitude, yet most software providers do not have accurate and efficient means for selecting among them. The paper describes a case study at Ericsson Radio Systems AB of two techniques for software requirements prioritizing as a means for determining the importance of candidate requirements, a pairwise comparison technique and a numeral assignment technique. The results from the case study indicate that the pairwise comparison technique is an efficient informative and accurate means for finding the candidate requirements importance. We therefore recommend the pairwise comparison technique for software requirements prioritizing. At Ericsson we have extended its use in other development projects.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a number of basic types and roles of ontologies, and use them as a basis to analyze several legal ontologies in the AI and Law literature. We discuss some dimensions in which to distinguish types of ontologies, for example considering their level of structure. We propose five main roles of ontologies in general: (a) organize and structure information; (b) reasoning and problem solving; (c) se-mantic indexing and search; (d) semantics integration and interoperation; and (e) understanding the domain. We then discuss example of works that have exploited each of these roles in the AI and Law literature. Further, we discuss some of the consequences of using ontologies to play each of these roles in terms of the level of structure of the knowledge represented in the ontologies, the kinds of knowledge representation formalisms they use, and the reasoning methods they employ.

AB  - Codes of conduct have long been a feature of corporate life. Today, they are arguably a legal necessity--at least for public companies with a presence in the United States. But the issue goes beyond U.S. legal and regulatory requirements. Sparked by corruption and excess of various types, dozens of industry, government, investor, and multisector groups worldwide have proposed codes and guidelines to govern corporate behavior. These initiatives reflect an increasingly global debate on the nature of corporate legitimacy. Given the legal, organizational, reputational, and strategic considerations, few companies will want to be without a code. But what should it say? Apart from a handful of essentials spelled out in Sarbanes-Oxley regulations and NYSE rules, authoritative guidance is sorely lacking. In search of some reference points for managers, the authors undertook a systematic analysis of a select group of codes. In this article, they present their findings in the form of a "codex," a reference source on code content. The Global Business Standards Codex contains a set of overarching principles as well as a set of conduct standards for putting those principles into practice. The GBS Codex is not intended to be adopted as is, but is meant to be used as a benchmark by those wishing to create their own world-class code. The provisions of the codex must be customized to a company's specific business and situation; individual companies' codes will include their own distinctive elements as well. What the codex provides is a starting point grounded in ethical fundamentals and aligned with an emerging global consensus on basic standards of corporate behavior.

AB  - The SALOMON project is a contribution to the automatic processing of legal texts. Its aim is to automatically summarise Belgian criminal cases in order to improve access to the large number of existing and future cases. Therefore, techniques are developed for identifying and extracting relevant information from the cases. A broader application of these techniques could considerably simplify the work of the legal profession.

A double methodology was used when developing SALOMON: the cases are processed by employing additional knowledge to interpret structural patterns and features on the one hand and by way of occurrence statistics of index terms on the other. As a result, SALOMON performs an initial categorisation and structuring of the cases and subsequently extracts the most relevant text units of the alleged offences and of the opinion of the court. The SALOMON techniques do not themselves solve any legal questions, but they do guide the user effectively towards relevant texts.

AB  - There is a growing interest in how people conceptualise the legal domain for the purpose of legal knowledge systems. In this paper we discuss four such conceptualisations (referred to as ontologies): McCarty's language for legal discourse, Stamper's norma formalism, Valente's functional ontology of law, and the ontology of Van Kralingen and Visser. We present criteria for a comparison of the ontologies and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the ontologies in relation to these criteria. Moreover, we critically review the criteria.

In this paper, we propose a our preliminary results to visualize abstract normative systems, in such a way that we are able to reason with institutional facts, obligations and permissions. Moreover, we detect meaningful patterns emerging from the proposed visualization, and we show how these patterns can be used to define commonly used reusable solutions.

AB  - As a result of recent scandals concerning evidence and proof in the administration of criminal justice – ranging from innocent people on death row in the United States to misuse of statistics leading to wrongful convictions in The Netherlands and elsewhere – inquiries into the logic of evidence and proof have taken on a new urgency both in an academic and practical sense. This study presents a broad perspective on logic by focusing on inference not just in isolation but as embedded in contexts of procedure and investigation. With special attention being paid to recent developments in Artificial Intelligence and the Law, specifically related to evidentiary reasoning, this book provides clarification of problems of logic and argumentation in relation to evidence and proof. As the vast majority of legal conflicts relate to contested facts, rather than contested law, this volume concerning facts as prime determinants of legal decisions presents an important contribution to the field for both scholars and practitioners.

AB  - Many organizations have turned toward globally distributed software development in their quest for higher-quality software delivered cheaply and quickly. But this kind of development has often been reported as problematic and complex to manage. One of the fundamental factors in determining the success and failure of globally distributed software teams is trust. The aim of our work has therefore been to describe the key factors causing lack of trust, and the main effects of lacking trust in such teams. From studying 4 projects, all located in two different countries, with trust problems we found the key factors to be poor socialization and socio-cultural fit, lack of face-to-face meetings, missing conflict handling and cognitive based trust, increased monitoring and too little communication. The effect of lacking trust was a decrease in productivity, quality, information exchange, feedback and morale among the employees; the monitoring increased and the employees doubted negative feedback from manager.

AB  - Computational approaches to the law have frequently been characterized as being formalistic implementations of the syllogistic model of legal cognition: using insufficient or contradictory data, making analogies, learning through examples and experiences, applying vague and imprecise standards. We argue that, on the contrary, studies on neural networks and fuzzy reasoning show how AI & law research can go beyond syllogism, and, in doing that, can provide substantial contributions to the law.

AB  - In order to represent legal knowledge adequately, it is vital to create a formal device that can freely construct an individual concept directly from a predicate expression. For this purpose, a Compound Predicate Formula (CPF) is formulated for use in legal expert systems. In this paper, we willattempt to explain the nature of CPFs by rigorous logical foundation, i.e., establishing their syntax and semantics precisely through the use of appropriate examples. We note the advantages of our system over other such systems and discuss the significance of CPFs with regard to the formalization of legal reasonings using examples from the United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods.

AB  - One of the main tasks of requirements engineering (RE) is the creation of a requirements document that precisely, consistently, and completely describes the functional and non-functional properties of the system to be built. At some point during the RE process, the requirements are written down using a natural language or a requirements specification language. On one hand, natural language is flexible, universal, and wide-spread. On the other hand, natural language requirements are recognized widely as being incomplete, inconsistent, and inherently ambiguous. Semi-formal and formal requirements specification techniques, such as UML [13] or SCR [5], have been proposed to overcome these deficiencies. Completeness and consistency of these specifications can be tackled to some degree mechanically by tools. However, as a recent study shows, ambiguity rarely surfaces during the development of a requirements model [10]. Thus, since a requirements specification technique enforces precision, the resulting requirements model becomes unambiguously wrong. In this paper, we show how to detect ambiguities in natural language requirements using a checklist. We distinguish between linguistic and RE-specific ambiguities. Linguistic ambiguities are those ambiguities that are usually discussed in RE textbooks such as ambiguous pronoun references. RE-specific ambiguities occur with respect to the RE context, which includes the application domain and the system domain. For example, the requirement (1) If the bank customer maintains a minimum balance in his or her checking account, there is no monthly service charge. is ambiguous not because of its linguistic representation, but because of the operational environment and application domain. In the requirements documents that we have investigated, RE-specific ambiguities account for the majority of ambiguities, while pure linguistic ambiguities played a less significant role. In this paper, we present also an approach that allows identifying types of RE-specific ambiguity from a metamodel, e.g., of a requirements specification technique. Based on the identified types of ambiguity, we have developed an improved inspection technique for natural language requirements on the basis of checklists and scenario-based reading.

AB  - Our legal expert system KONTERM contains a selective thesaurus and a knowledge base for the automatic representation of the structure and the contents of the document. The thesaurus takes into account the necessary degree of formalism of legal language and therefore overcomes the untidiness of natural language and represents automatically the expert knowledge of a lawyer about legal terminology. The required selectivity of the individual descriptors is achieved by distinguishing between precise legal terms and words with fuzzy meanings as well as by detecting hidden word senses. This thesaurus, together with the expert rules for structuring the document, provides the user with an analytical document representation. In addition to that, hypertext links will be supplemented in order to offer the lawyer a convenient tool for efficient information retrieval.

AB  - Most of the software in regular use in businesses and organisations all over the world cannot be completely specified. It cannot be implemented, once and for all. Both the original implementation and the inevitable subsequent evolution (maintenance) are a continual learning experience driven, i>inter alia, by feedback from the results of the behaviour under execution of the software, as perceived by various stakeholders, by advances and growth in the user organisations and by adaptation to changes in the external world, both independent and as a result of installation and use of the software. Real world, termed type-i>E, software is essentially evolutionary in nature. The study of the processes of evolution of such software is of considerable interest, as is that of the domains that co-evolve with the software. After briefly discussing the meaning of the term i>evolution in the context of software, its technology, the software process and related domains, this paper describes some of the facets of the evolution phenomenon and implications to the evolution process as identified during many years of active interest in the topic.

AB  - Laws and regulations are playing an increasingly important role in requirements engineering and systems development. Monitoring systems for requirements and policy compliance has been recognized in the requirements engineering community as a key area for research. Similarly, legal compliance is critical in systems development, especially given that non-compliance can result in both financial and criminal penalties. Working with legal texts can be very challenging, however, because they contain numerous ambiguities, cross-references, domain-specific definitions, and acronyms, and are frequently amended via new statutes, regulations, and case law. Requirements engineers and compliance auditors must be able to identify relevant legal texts, extract requirements and other key concepts, and monitor compliance. This chapter surveys research efforts over the past 50 years in handling legal texts for systems development. This survey can aid requirements engineers and auditors to better specify, test, and monitor systems for compliance.

AB  - The Pierson vs. Post case [1] has become an important benchmark in the field of AI and Law for computational models of argumentation. In [2], Bench-Capon used Pierson vs. Post to motivate the use of values and value preferences in his theory-construction account of legal argument. And in a more a recent paper by Atkinson, Bench-Capon and McBurney [3], it was used to illustrate a formalization of an argumentation scheme for practical reasoning. Here we offer yet another reconstruction of Pierson vs. Post, using our Carneades Argumentation Framework, a formal mathematical model of argument structure and evaluation based on Walton's theory of argumentation [4], and compare it to this prior work. Carneades, named in honor of the Greek skeptic philosopher who emphasized the importance of plausible reasoning, applies proof standards [5] to determine the defensibility of arguments and the acceptability of statements on an issue-by-issue basis.

It has been argued that full regulatory compliance requires information on not only the structure of processes but also on what the tasks in a process do. To this end Governatori and Sadiq [2007] proposed to extend business processes with semantic annotations. We propose a methodology to automatically extract one kind of such annotations; in particular the annotations related to the data schema and templates linked to the various tasks in a business process.

AB  - One of the main emerging challenges in legal documentation is to capture the meaning and the semantics of normative content using NLP techniques, and to isolate the relevant part of the linguistic speech. The last five years have seen an explosion in XML schemas and DTDs whose focus in modelling legal resources their focus was on structure. Now that the basic elements of textual descriptiveness are well formalized, we can use this knowledge to proceed with content. This paper presents a detailed methodology for classifying modificatory provisions in depth and providing all the necessary information for semiautomatically managing the consolidation process. The methodology is based on an empirical legal analysis of about 29,000 Italian acts, where we bring out regularities in the language associated with some modifications, and where we define patterns of proprieties for each type of modificatory provision. The list of verbs and the frames inferred through this empirical legal analysis have been used by the NLP group at the University of Turin to refine a syntactical NLP parser for isolating and representing the sentences as syntactic trees, and the pattern will be used by the light semantic interpreter module to indentify the parameters of modificatory provisions.

AB  - The IST project SEKT (Semantically Enabled Knowledge Technologies) aims at developing semantic technologies by integrating knowledge management, text mining, and human language technology. Tools and methodologies implemented in the SEKT project are employed and optimized in three case studies, one of them being concerned with intelligent integrated decision support for legal professionals. The main goal of this case study is to offer decision support to newly appointed judges in Spain by means of iFAQ, an intelligent Frequently Asked Questions system based on a complex ontology of the legal domain. Building this ontology is a tedious and time-consuming task requiring profound knowledge of legal documents and language. Therefore, any kind of automatic support can significantly increase the efficiency of the knowledge acquisition process. In this paper we present Text2Onto, an open-source tool for ontology learning, and our experiments with legal case study data. The previously existing English version of Text2Onto has been adapted to support the linguistic analysis of Spanish texts, including language-specific algorithms for the extraction of ontological concepts, instances and relations. Text2Onto greatly facilitated the automatic generation of the initial version of the Spanish legal ontology from a given collection of Spanish documents. In further iterative steps which included a mixture of learning and manual effort the ontology has been refined and applied to the real-world case study.

We implemented and evaluated these methods in SMILE+IBP, which predicts the outcome of legal cases given a textual summary. Our approach uses classification-based methods for assigning indices. In our experiments, we compare different methods for representing text cases, and also consider multiple learning algorithms. The evaluation shows that a text representation that combines some background knowledge and NLP combined with a nearest neighbor algorithm leads to the best performance for our TCBR task.

I discuss how the implementations of neural networks have failed to account for legal theoretical perspectives on adjudication. I criticise the use of neural networks in law, not because connectionism is inherently unsuitable in law, but rather because it has been done so poorly to date. The paper reviews a number of legal theories which provide a grounding for the use of neural networks in law. It then examines some implementations undertaken in law and criticises their legal theoretical naivete. It then presents a lessons from the implementations which researchers must bear in mind if they wish to build neural networks which are justified by legal theories.

AB  - What strategies do lawyers and judges use to read the law? The study described in this article examined the way in which 10 legal experts (8 lawyers and 2 judges) and 10 novices (law students in the top 50% of their class) read a judicial opinion. Whereas the experts read efficiently (taking less overall time), the beginning law students read less efficiently. Where the experts read the text flexibly, moving back and forth between different parts of the opinion, the novices read inflexibly. The experts connected to the purpose of their reading more consistently than the novices and drew upon their prior knowledge and experience with the law. The results of this study suggest that we can give our students the following advice in order to read like legal experts: (1) Read with a purpose; (2) Use background knowledge to situate the case; (3) Establish the context of the case before beginning to read; (4) Evaluate the case and have an opinion about its outcome; and (5) Read flexibly; skim and skip when appropriate. By examining the actual transcripts of lawyers and judges reading a case, this article illustrates how we can teach our students to read like legal experts. The earlier they achieve these skills, the better for the individual students, the more likely their success in law school and the better for the legal profession as a whole.

AB  - One criticism often advanced against abstract argumentation frameworks (AFs), is that these consider only one form of interaction between atomic arguments: specifically that an argument attacks another. Attempts to broaden the class of relationships include bipolar frameworks, where arguments support others, and abstract dialectical frameworks (ADFs). The latter, allow "acceptance" of an argument, x, to be predicated on a given propositional function, Cx, dependent on the corresponding acceptance of its parents, i.e. those y for which 〈y, x〉 occurs. Although offering a richly expressive formalism subsuming both standard and bipolar AFs, an issue that arises with ADFs is whether this expressiveness is achieved in a manner that would be infeasible within standard AFs. Can the semantics used in ADFs be mapped to some AF semantics? How many arguments are needed in an AF to "simulate" an ADF? We show that (in a formally defined sense) any ADF can be simulated by an AF of similar size and that this translation can be realised by a polynomial time algorithm.

AB  - This research updates and delineates thedisproportionality of federal regulations' cost burden on small business. Thereport divides federal regulations into four categories: economic, workplace,environmental, and tax compliance. The two main components of economicregulation are estimated separately. The estimated costs of economic regulations affecting international tradeare mainly derived from the report issued by the U.S. International TradeCommission in 2004. Other data are from the Organization for EconomicCooperation and Development, with gaps in the baseline filled with Office ofManagement and Budget (OMB) estimates. The costs of workplace regulations are based on updated estimates from astudy by Johnson (Office of Advocacy, 2005). Environmental regulationsestimates are mainly based on OMB reports. Tax compliance costs are based on the 2002 report from the Tax Foundation.The allocation of costs across employment classes was derived from census datapublished by the Office of Advocacy. In the face of higher costs of federal regulations, findings show that smallbusinesses continue to bear a disproportionate share of the federal regulatoryburden, totaling $1.1 trillion or $7,647 per employee for firms with fewer thantwenty employees.

More than ever, we need sense-making tools to help negotiate understanding in the face of multi-stakeholder, ill-structured problems. In order to be effective, these tools must support human cognitive and discursive processes, and provide suitable representations, services and user interfaces.

Visualizing Argumentation is written by practitioners and researchers for colleagues working in collaborative knowledge media, educational technology and organizational sense-making. It will also be of interest to theorists interested in software tools which embody different argumentation models. Particular emphasis is placed on the usability and effectiveness of tools in different contexts.

AB  - For more than a decade constructing ontologies for legal domains, we, at the Leibniz Center for Law, felt really the need to develop a core ontology for law that would enable us to re-use the common denominator of the various legal domains. In this paper we present two core ontologies for law. The first one was the result of a PhD thesis by [Valente, 1995], called FOLaw. FOLaw speci- fies functional dependencies between types of knowledge involved in legal reasoning. Despite the fact that FOLaw was the starting point for a number of ontologies and legal reasoning systems in various (European) projects, it is rather an epistemological framework than a (core) ontology. We are not the only ones who easily confound epistemology with ontology. In the paper we present some examples and discuss whether this epistemological promiscuity in (core) ontology development is a serious problem. It is to some extent, as it limits the scope of re-use (if not leading to confusion). Therefore, we started about four years ago the development of a 'real' core-ontology for law based upon notions of common sense. The reason for a common-sense foundation is that domain independent concepts of law - the common denominator - are still tainted with a strong common-sense flavor. Moreover, domains of law refer to social activities which are generally governed by common-sense notions. This core ontology, called LRI-Core, consists of five major portions ('worlds'): physical, mental and abstract classes; roles and occurrences.

AB  - Legal texts are the foundational resource where to discover rules and norms that feed into different concrete (often XML-based) Web applications. Legislative documents provide general norms and specific procedural rules for eGovernment and eCommerce environments, while contracts specify the conditions of services and business rules (e.g. service level agreements for cloud computing), and judgments provide information about the legal argumentation and interpretation of norms to concrete case-law. Such legal knowledge is an important source that should be detected, properly modeled and expressively represented in order to capture all the domain particularities. This paper provides an extension of RuleML called LegalRuleML for fostering the characteristics of legal knowledge and to permit its full usage in legal reasoning and in the business rule domain. LegalRuleML encourages the effective exchange and sharing of such semantic information between legal documents, business rules, and software applications.

AB  - Developing large complex software products aimed for a broad market involves a great flow of wishes and requirements. The former are elicited from customers while the latter are brought forth by the developing organization. These are preferably kept separated to preserve the different perspectives. The interrelationships should however be identified and maintained to enable well-founded decisions. Unfortunately, the current manual linkage is cumbersome, time-consuming, and error-prone. This work presents a pragmatic linguistic engineering approach to how statistical natural language processing may be used to support the manual linkage between customer wishes and product requirements by suggesting potential links. An evaluation with real requirements from industry is presented. It shows that in a realistic setting, automatic support could make linkage faster for at least 50% of the links. An estimation based on our evaluation also shows that considerable time savings are possible. The results, together with the identified enhancement, are promising for improving software quality and saving time in industrial requirements engineering.

AB  - The ASPIC+ framework is intermediate in abstraction between Dung's argumentation framework and concrete instantiating logics. This paper generalises ASPIC+ to accommodate classical logic instantiations, and adopts a new proposal for evaluating extensions: attacks are used to define the notion of conflict-free sets, while the defeats obtained by applying preferences to attacks, are exclusively used to determine the acceptability of arguments. Key properties and rationality postulates are then shown to hold for the new framework.

AB  - The ever-increasing obligations of regulatory compliance are presenting a new breed of challenges for organizations across several industry sectors. Aligning control objectives that stem from regulations and legislation with business objectives devised for improved business performance is a foremost challenge. The organizational as well as IT structures for the two classes of objectives are often distinct and potentially in conflict. In this chapter, we present an overarching methodology for aligning business and control objectives. The various phases of the methodology are then used as a basis for discussing state-of-the-art in compliance management. Contributions from research and academia as well as industry solutions are discussed. The chapter concludes with a discussion on the role of BPM as a driver for regulatory compliance and a presentation of open questions and challenges.

AB  - Compliance checking is gaining importance as today's organizations need to show that operational processes are executed in a controlled manner while satisfying predefined (legal) requirements or service level agreements. Deviations may be costly and expose an organization to severe risks. Compliance checking is of growing importance for the business process management and auditing communities. This paper presents an approach for checking compliance of observed process executions recorded in an event log to temporal compliance requirements, which restrict when particular activities may or may not occur. We show how temporal compliance requirements discussed in literature can be unified and formalized using a generic temporal compliance rule. To check compliance with respect to a temporal rule, the event log describing the observed behavior is aligned with the rule. The alignment then shows which events occurred out of order and which events deviated by which amount of time from the prescribed behavior. This approach integrates with an existing approach for control-flow compliance checking, allowing for multi-perspective diagnostic information in case of compliance violations. We show the feasibility of our technique by checking temporal compliance rules of real life event logs.

AB  - Managing regulatory compliance is increasingly challenging and costly for organizations world-wide. While such efforts are often supported by information technology (IT) and information systems (IS) tools, there is evidence that the current solutions are inadequate and do not fully address the needs of organizations. Often such discrepancy stems from a lack of alignment between the needs of the industry and the focus of academic research efforts. In this paper, we present the results of an empirical study that investigates challenges in managing regulatory compliance, derived from expert professionals in the Australian compliance industry. The results provide insights into problematic areas within the compliance management domain, as related to regulatees, regulations and IT compliance management solutions. By relating the identified challenges to existing activity in IS research, this exploratory paper highlights the inadequacy of current research and presents the first industry-relevant compliance management research agenda for IS researchers.

Unfortunately, there is a major obstacle in realizing such applications: tourist (or other) information on the Web has to be semantically annotated, and this happens to be a very time- and resource-consuming process. In this work we present the application of a lightweight automated approach for the annotation of accommodation advertisements. The annotation tool, called Cerno, allows for annotation of text according to a predefined conceptual schema. Resulting annotations are stored in a database, allowing users to quickly find the best match to personal requirements. To evaluate our framework, we have conducted a series of experiments that support the efficacy of our proposal with respect to annotation quality and fulfilment of user information needs.

AB  - This paper investigates whether current nonmonotonic logics are suitable for formalising the defeasibility of legal reasoning. It does so by studying the role of burden of proof in legal argument, in particular how allocations of burden of proof determine the required strength of counterarguments. It is argued that the two currently available modelling approaches both have some shortcomings. On the one hand, techniques for modelling burden of proof in nonmonotonic logics do not allow for shifts of the burden of proof from one party to the other. On the other hand, current procedural models of legal argument are too rigid, in that every counterargument induces a shift of proof burdens; this fails to respect that in legal reasoning burden shifts only occur in some cases. It is then shown how current dialectical models of defeasible reasoning can be adapted to overcome these shortcomings.

AB  - The article introduces JudO, an OWL2 ontology library of legal knowledge that relies on the metadata contained in judicial documents. JudO represents the interpretations performed by a judge while conducting legal reasoning towards the adjudication of a case. To the aim of this application, judicial interpretation is intended in the restricted sense of the acts of judicial subsumption performed by the judge when he considers a material instance (token in Searle's terminology), and assigns it to an abstract category (type). The ontology library is based on a theoretical model and on some specific patterns that exploit some new features introduced by OWL2. JudO provides meaningful legal semantics, while retaining a strong connection to source documents (fragments of legal texts). The application task is to enable detection and modeling of jurisprudence-related information directly from the text, and to perform shallow reasoning on the resulting knowledge base. The ontology library is also supposed to support a defeasible rule set for legal argumentation on the groundings of judicial decisions.

AB  - The study of rationality and practical reason, or rationality in action, has been central to Western intellectual culture. In this invigorating book, John Searle lays out six claims of what he calls the Classical Model of rationality and shows why they are false. He then presents an alternative theory of the role of rationality in thought and action. A central point of Searle's theory is that only irrational actions are directly caused by beliefs and desires -- for example, the actions of a person in the grip of an obsession or addiction. In most cases of rational action, there is a gap between the motivating desire and the actual decision making. The traditional name for this gap is "freedom of the will." According to Searle, all rational activity presupposes free will. For rationality is possible only where one has a choice among various rational as well as irrational options. Unlike many philosophical tracts, Rationality in Action invites the reader to apply the author's ideas to everyday life. Searle shows, for example, that contrary to the traditional philosophical view, weakness of will is very common. He also points out the absurdity of the claim that rational decision making always starts from a consistent set of desires. Rational decision making, he argues, is often about choosing between conflicting reasons for action. In fact, humans are distinguished by their ability to be rationally motivated by desire-independent reasons for action. Extending his theory of rationality to the self, Searle shows how rational deliberation presupposes an irreducible notion of the self. He also reveals the idea of free will to be essentially a thesis of how the brain works.

AB  - In this article we present an overview of legal ontological modeling over a period of more than a decade. Most of the research reported concerns results from mid-size (European) projects aimed at the development of legal reasoning and information management tools and systems. In these projects we developed ontologies for several legal or regulation domains. However, the main thread of this article is provided by fundamental research performed by us or under our supervision (e.g. PhD theses by [1], [2], [3]), leading to more abstract legal ‘core' ontologies and legal reasoning architectures. The major insights we have obtained from these experiences can be summarized as follows:

Legal sources contain and assume non-legal, common-sense based domain knowledge. Therefore, a legal core ontology should be rooted in highly abstract common sense concepts as a foundational ontology. This notion is worked out in the LRI-Core ontology, presented in this article.

What remains as typical legal knowledge to be modelled is normative and legal responsability knowledge. However, in this article we only summarize our work in this area, refering to [4] and to [5] on these issues.

As law and legal theory is focussed on questions of justification, legal (core) ontologies, e.g. FOLaw, are epistemological frameworks, describing legal reasoning, rather than legal ontologies, explaining knowledge resources.

This article describes the derivation and validation of the Automated Readability Index (ARI) for use with technical materials. The method allows for the easy, automatic collection of data as narrative material is typed on a slightly modified electric typewriter. Data collected includes word length (a measure of word difficulty) and sentence length (a measure of sentence difficulty). Appropriate weightings of these factors in a multiple regression equation result in an index of reading difficulty. Uses of the index for evaluating and controlling the readability of large quantities of technical material are described.

AB  - Case-based reasoning in the law is a reasoning strategy in which legal conclusions are supported by decisions made by judges. If the case at hand is analogous to a settled case, then by judicial authority one can argue that the settled case should be followed. Case-based reasoning is a topic where ontology meets logic since one’s conception of cases determines one’s conception of reasoning with cases. In the paper, it is shown how reasoning with cases can be modelled by comparing the corresponding dialectical arguments. A unique characteristic thereby is the explicit recognition that it is in principle contingent which case features are relevant for case comparison. This contigency gives rise to some typical reasoning patterns. The present work is compared to other existing approaches to reasoning by case comparison, and some work on legal ontologies is briefly discussed regarding the role attributed to cases.

AB  - In common law contexts, legal cases are decided with respect to precedents rather than legislation as in civil law contexts. Legal professionals must find, analyse, and reason with and about cases drawn from a set of cases (a case base). A range of particular textual elements of a case may be relevant to query and extract. Commercial providers of legal information allow legal professionals to search a case base by keywords and meta data. However, the case base and the search tools are proprietary, of limited, non-extensible functionality, and are restricted access. Moreover, no provider applies natural language processing techniques to the cases for text analysis, XML annotation, or information acquisition. In this paper, we discuss an initial experiment in developing and applying natural language processing tools to cases to produce annotated text which can then support information extraction.

AB  - In attempting to understand information system environments during requirements engineering, it is often helpful to have an understanding of the 'whys' as well as the 'whats' about the environment. A natural way to answer why questions is by tracing them to goals. In an organizational environment, however, the whys do not originate from a single set of given goals. Organizational agents depend on each other for goals to be achieved, tasks to be performed, and resources to be furnished. A requirements model that captures knowledge about an organizational environment can be enriched by including the network of dependency relationships among agents. A set of intentional operators for modeling dependencies among agents is proposed, and a preliminary axiomatic characterization is presented. >

Ontology is needed to describe products, services, processes and practices in any e-commerce application. Ontology plays an essential role in recognizing the meaning of the information in Web documents. This paper attempts to deploy these concepts in an e-law application. E-laws ontology has been built using existing resources. It has been shown that extracting concepts is less hard than building relationships among them. A new algorithm has been proposed to reduce the number of relationships, so the domain knowledge expert (i.e. lawyer) can refine these relationships.

TI  - SYMBOLIC LOGIC: A RAZOR-EDGED TOOL FOR DRAFTING AND INTERPRETING LEGAL DOCUMENTS

AB  - A large amount of the litigation based on written instruments?whether statute, contract, will, conveyance or regulation?can be traced to the draftsman's failure to convey his meaning clearly. Frequently, of course, certain items may purposely be left ambiguous, but often the question in issue is due to an inadvertent ambiguity that could have been avoided had the draftsman clearly expressed what he intended to say. In this Article it is suggested that a new approach to drafting, using certain elementary notions of symbolic logic, can go a long way towards eliminating such inadvertent ambiguity. This new approach makes available to draftsmen a technique that achieves some of the clarity, precision and efficiency of analysis that symbolic logic provides. In addition, it can be a valuable aid in moving towards a more comprehensive and systematic method of interpretation,1 as well as drafting. This approach is a compromise between expression in ordinary prose and expression in the mathematical notation of symbolic logic?enough like ordi? nary prose to be understood easily by any careful reader, enough like sym? bolic logic to achieve some of its important advantages. It represents an effort to adapt some of the techniques of symbolic logic to make more systematic what is now best described as the "art" of drafting. The first section will explain six elementary logical connectives: implication, conjunction, coimplication, exclusive disjunction, inclusive disjunction and negation. In order to simplify this exposition, trivial examples will be used for purposes of illustration. In the second section the proposed system will be applied to actual legal problems of drafting, interpretation, simplification and comparison. Six Elementary Logical Connectives 2 1.0 Implication The development of a more systematic method of drafting will enable the lawyer to communicate his intended meaning more effectively. That is the basic proposition to which this Article is addressed. This same proposition can be stated in a different form:

AB  - The Web is the greatest information source in human history. Unfortunately, mining knowledge out of this source is a laborious and error-prone task. Many researchers believe that a solution to the problem can be founded on semantic annotations that need to be inserted in web-based documents and guide information extraction and knowledge mining. In this paper, we further elaborate a tool-supported process for semantic annotation of documents based on techniques and technologies traditionally used in software analysis and reverse engineering for large-scale legacy code bases. The outcomes of the paper include an experimental evaluation framework and empirical results based on two case studies adopted from the Tourism sector. The conclusions suggest that our approach can facilitate the semi-automatic annotation of large document bases.

AB  - Goals are a logical mechanism for identifying, organizing and justifying software requirements. Strategies are needed for the initial identification and construction of goals. We discuss goals from the perspective of two themes: goal analysis and goal evolution. We begin with an overview of the goal-based method we have developed and summarize our experiences in applying our method to a relatively large example. We illustrate some of the issues that practitioners face when using a goal-based approach to specify the requirements for a system and close the paper with a discussion of needed future research on goal-based requirements analysis and evolution.

AB  - The specification and monitoring of conditional obligations and prohibitions with starting points and deadlines is a crucial aspect in the design of open interaction systems. In this paper we regard such obligations and prohibitions as cases of social commitment, and propose to model them in OWL, the logical language recommended by the W3C for Semantic Web applications. In particular we propose an application-independent ontology of the notions of social commitment, temporal proposition, event, agent, role and norms that can be used in the specification of any open interaction system. We then delineate a hybrid solution that uses the OWL ontology, SWRL rules, and a Java program to dynamically monitor or simulate the temporal evolution of social commitments, due to the elapsing of time and to the actions performed by the agents interacting within the system.

AB  - This paper extends our previous logical analysis of presumptions and burden of proof by studying the force of a presumption once counterevidence has been offered. In the jurisprudential literature different accounts of this issue have been given: some have argued that a presumption is nullified by counterarguments while others have maintained that this gives presumptions a force that is too slight. We argue that these differences largely are not a matter of logic but of legal policy, and we show how the various accounts can be logically formalised.

This study assessed physicians' adoption of outpatient electronic health records, their satisfaction with such systems, the perceived effect of the systems on the quality of care, and the perceived barriers to adoption. Methods In late 2007 and early 2008, we conducted a national survey of 2758 physicians, which represented a response rate of 62%. Using a definition for electronic health records that was based on expert consensus, we determined the proportion of physicians who were using such records in an office setting and the relationship between adoption and the characteristics of individual physicians and their practices. Results Four percent of physicians reported having an extensive, fully functional electronic-records system, and 13% reported having a basic system.

AB  - In this article, we propose a survey of the use of bipolarity in argumentation frameworks. On the one hand, the notion of bipolarity relies on the presence of two kinds of entities that have a diametrically opposed nature and that represent repellent forces (a positive entity and a negative entity). The notion exists in various domains (for example with the representation of preferences in artificial intelligence, or in cognitive psychology). On the other hand, argumentation process is a promising approach for reasoning, based on the construction and the comparison of arguments. It follows five steps: building the arguments, defining the interactions between these arguments, valuating the arguments, selecting the most acceptable arguments and, finally, drawing a conclusion. Using the nomenclature proposed by Dubois and Prade, this article shows on various applications, and with some formal definitions, that bipolarity appears in argumentation (in some cases if not always) and can be used in each step of this process under different forms. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Automated requirements traceability methods that utilize Information Retrieval (IR) methods to generate and maintain traceability links are often more efficient than traditional manual approaches, however the traces they generate are imprecise and significant human effort is needed to evaluate and filter the results. This paper investigates and compares three term-based enhancement methods that are designed to improve the performance of a probabilistic automated tracing tool. Empirical studies show that the enhancement methods can be effective in increasing the accuracy of the retrieved traces; however the effectiveness of each method varies according to specific project characteristics. The analysis of such characteristics has lead to the development of two new project-level metrics which can be used to predict the effectiveness of each enhancement method for a given data set. A procedure to automatically extract critical keywords and phrases from a set of traceable artifacts is also presented to enhance the automated trace retrieval algorithm. The procedure is tested on two new datasets.

AB  - Changes to software requirements not only pose a risk to the successful delivery of software applications but also provide opportunity for improved usability and value. Increased understanding of the causes and consequences of change can support requirements management and also make progress towards the goal of change anticipation. This paper presents the results of two case studies that address objectives arising from that ultimate goal. The first case study evaluated the potential of a change source taxonomy containing the elements ‘market’, ‘organisation’, ‘vision’, ‘specification’, and ‘solution’ to provide a meaningful basis for change classification and measurement. The second case study investigated whether the requirements attributes of novelty, complexity, and dependency correlated with requirements volatility. While insufficiency of data in the first case study precluded an investigation of changes arising due to the change source of ‘market’, for the remainder of the change sources, results indicate a significant difference in cost, value to the customer and management considerations. Findings show that higher cost and value changes arose more often from ‘organisation’ and ‘vision’ sources; these changes also generally involved the co-operation of more stakeholder groups and were considered to be less controllable than changes arising from the ‘specification’ or ‘solution’ sources. Results from the second case study indicate that only ‘requirements dependency’ is consistently correlated with volatility and that changes coming from each change source affect different groups of requirements. We conclude that the taxonomy can provide a meaningful means of change classification, but that a single requirement attribute is insufficient for change prediction. A theoretical causal account of requirements change is drawn from the implications of the combined results of the two case studies.

It provides an environment for mapping the linguistic extractions with the domain ontology thanks to knowledge acquisition rules. Those rules are activated when a pertinent linguistic tag is reached. Those linguistic tags are then mapped to a concept, one of its attributes or even a semantic relation between several concepts. The rules instantiate these concepts, attributes and relations in the knowledge base constrained by the domain ontology. This paper deals with the underlying knowledge capture process and presents the first experiments realized on a real client application from the legal publishing domain.

AB  - To make legal arguments, one needs certain information about how to use cases effectively - dialectical information. In the broadest sense, dialectical information includes strategies for employing cases to justify legal conclusions (and responding to such justifications) and criteria for finding cases and deciding which cases to use. Making dialectical information explicit is important for teaching case-based argument. It is our experience that typically, law students do not have a very good set of dialectical strategies nor are they aware of the criteria. Even the most sophisticated legal information retrieval tools do not make such dialectical information explicit and assume that users have already learned it.  For purposes of instruction, we have identified some useful dialectical information comprising a flexible argument plan, a set of eight argument moves that embody standard ways for using cases as examples in an argument, factors for representing factual strengths and weaknesses in cases, and an annotated Claim Lattice for organizing cases for the purpose of selecting and making argument moves to implement the plan. Our tutorial program CATO makes this dialectical information explicit through a combination of information retrieval tools and graphical display. In this paper, an extended example illustrated the utility, for an expert, of this dialectical information for constructing a sophisticated legal argument from the argument moves. We believe that practice with the CATO program will make students aware of the existence of argumentative strategies and criteria and help them to apply this dialectical information to construct better arguments.

AB  - Systems Integration (SI) is an important element of Systems Engineering. It involves the integration of hardware, software, products, services, processes, and humans. The ever-increasing scale of complexity of systems and its impact on the business requires that we revisit the processes involved in the development and integration of a system. This paper proposes a Systems Integration Process Model (SIPM) based on a comprehensive lifecycle view of systems integration. As part of the ongoing SI research at Stevens Institute of Technology, the authors have developed a Systems Integration Framework (SIF) which incorporates the relevant aspects of integration from a lifecycle perspective and sets a foundation to an end-to-end approach to SI. Our end-to-end approach focuses on how integration issues can be addressed up-front to minimize integration related complexities and challenges later on in the system engineering process. This paper discusses the merits and benefits of applying the SIPM to evaluate and improve current SI processes in organizations. The paper provides, in addition to an overview of the SI framework, the activities included in the model. The model was pilot tested to evaluate the SI processes at a government agency. The results were used to provide recommendations for SI process reengineering. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Syst Eng

AB  - A legal knowledge based system called JUSTICE is presented which provides conceptual information retrieval for legal cases. JUSTICE can identify heterogeneous representations of concepts across all major Australian jurisdictions. The knowledge representation scheme used for legal and common sense concepts is inspired by human processes for the identification of concepts and the expected order and location of concepts. These are supported by flexible search functions and various string utilities. JUSTICE is a client-based legal software agent which works with both plaintext and HTML representations of legal cases over file systems, and the World Wide Web. In creating JUSTICE an ontology for legal cases was developed, and is implicit within JUSTICE. Further, the identification of concepts within data is shown to be a process enabling conceptual information retrieval and search, conceptualised summarisation, automated statistical analysis, and the conversion of informal documents into formalised semi-structured representations. JUSTICE was tested on the precision, recall and usefulness of its concept identifications; achieving good results. The results show the promise of the approach and establish JUSTICE as an intelligent legal research aid offering improved multifaceted access to the concepts within legal cases.

Technical Integrity encompasses fitness for service, system safety and minimised environmental impact. The beginnings of a program of research to test the hypothesis that “The application of technical regulation yields improved technical integrity of the complex engineered system” are established. It is shown that only the intended emergent properties of a complex engineered system and its unintended hazards are directly addressed by technical regulation. A candidate set of measures to assess technical integrity is proposed. The methods that may enhance technical integrity of complex systems are reviewed. The degrees to which technical regulatory frameworks actually enforce methods known to have a contribution to technical integrity are also reviewed resulting in a list of corollary questions to be considered by future research.

AB  - This paper describes the Common Pattern Specification Language (CPSL) that was developed during the TIPSTER program by a committee of researchers from the TIPSTER research sites. Many information extraction systems work by matching regular expressions over the lexical features of input symbols. CPSL was designed as a language for specifying such finite-state grammars for the purpose of specifying information extraction rules in a relatively system-independent way. The adoption of such a common language would enable the creation of shareable resources for the development of rule-based information extraction systems.

AB  - Two Party Immediate Response Disputes (TPI-disputes) are one class of dialogue or argument game in which the protagonists take turns producing counter arguments to the 'most recent' argument advanced by their opponent. Argument games have been found useful as a means of modelling dialectical discourse and in providing semantic bases for proof theoretic aspects of reasoning. In this article we consider a formalisation of TPI-disputes in the context of finite Argument Systems. Our principal concern may, informally, be phrased as follows: given a specific argument system, H, and argument x within H, what can be stated concerning the number of moves a dispute might take for one of its protagonists to accept that x has some defence respectively cannot be defended?

AB  - This paper is a tutorial introduction to the theory of programming language semantics developed by D. Scott and C. Strachey. The application of the theory to formal language specification is demonstrated and other applications are surveyed. The first language considered, LOOP, is very elementary and its definition merely introduces the notation and methodology of the approach. Then the semantic concepts of environments, stores, and continuations are introduced to model classes of programming language features and the underlying mathematical theory of computation due to Scott is motivated and outlined. Finally, the paper presents a formal definition of the language GEDANKEN.

AB  - Automated trace retrieval methods can significantly reduce the cost and effort needed to create and maintain requirements traces. However, the set of generated traces is generally quite imprecise and must be manually evaluated by analysts. In applied settings when the retrieval algorithm is unable to find the relevant links for a given query, a human user can improve the trace results by manually adding additional search terms and filtering out unhelpful ones. However, the effectiveness of this approach is largely dependent upon the knowledge of the user. In this paper we present an automated technique for replacing the original query with a new set of query terms. These query terms are learned through seeding a web-based search with the original query and then processing the results to identify a set of domain-specific terms. The query-mining algorithm was evaluated and fine-tuned using security regulations from the USA government's Health Insurance Privacy and Portability Act (HIPAA) traced against ten healthcare related requirements specifications.

AB  - Italian Ministry of Justice, with the contributions of the researcher centres, universities and public bodies, are presently engaged in an effort to work out shared standards with which to represent legal texts. Documents standardised under uniform formats and structures make it possible to link up distinct bodies of norms, and this in turn makes it easier to find and look up norms and design tools with which to process them, as when doing legal drafting and bringing out consolidated texts. This function is enabled by marking up the different parts of a legal text: its identification data (indicating text type, text number, date of delivery, and the like), its partitions (e.g., the articles and sections that make up its layout), and the normative references it contains.

AB  - The objective of this study is to present a body of evidence that will assist software project managers to make informed choices about software development approaches for their projects. In particular, two broadly defined competing approaches, the traditional “waterfall” approach and iterative and incremental development (IID), are compared with regards to development cost and duration, and resulting product quality. The method used for this comparison is a systematic literature review. The small set of studies we located did not demonstrate any identifiable cost, duration, or quality trends, although there was some evidence suggesting the superiority of IID (in particular XP). The results of this review indicate that further empirical studies, both quantitative and qualitative, on this topic need to be undertaken. In order to effectively compare study results, the research community needs to reach a consensus on a set of comparable parameters that best assess cost, duration, and quality.

AB  - This paper proposes a model of  ration decidendi  as a justification structure consisting of a series of reasoning steps, some of which relate abstract predicates to other abstract predicates and some of which relate abstract predicates to specific facts. This model satisfies four adequacy criteria for  ratio decidendi  identified from the jurisprudential literature. In particular, the model shows how the theory under which a case is decided controls its precedential effect. By contrast, a purely case-based model of  ratio  fails to account for the dependency of precedential effect on the theory of decision.

We examine several different winning criteria and several different dialogue types, where a dialogue type is determined by a set of positions, an attack relation between positions and a legal-move function. We examine two proof theories, where a proof theory is determined by a dialogue type and a winning criterion. For each of the proof theories we supply a corresponding declarative semantics.

AB  - This paper provides a computational framework, based on defeasible logic, to capture some aspects of institutional agency. Our background is Kanger-Lindahl-Porn account of organised interaction, which describes this interaction within a multi-modal logical setting. This work focuses in particular on the notions of counts-as link and on those of attempt and of personal and direct action to realise states of affairs. We show how standard defeasible logic (DL) can be extended to represent these concepts: the resulting system preserves some basic properties commonly attributed to them. In addition, the framework enjoys nice computational properties, as it turns out that the extension of any theory can be computed in time linear to the size of the theory itself.

AB  - Legal provisions are considered as interrelated fragments of a text with some structural relations which hold between them. Some provisions are treated as meta-provisions, in case they are used to enact, repeal or amend the substantial provisions. The meaning of a meta-provision is described by meta-norms. Every meta-norm is conditioned by a certain event, and it describes the action which should be executed in order to obtain the current properties of the provision, such as its current text content or the current structural relations holding between the provisions. The presented model of the legal provisions dynamics is based on the event calculus, which is used to represent how the provision properties change in time. The model can be easily implemented in Prolog.

AB  - The authors have observed that traditional requirements engineering practices are inadequate to support large projects that are defined by a contract. Unlike a product development effort, contract requirements are not at a uniform level so the typical “V” model for tracing does not work well. Other important attributes of contracts such as penalty clauses, contract options, incentive payments, regulatory codes and standards, cross-cutting and project execution requirements all need to be considered. This paper describes some of the challenges and recommended best practices for the management of requirements on large contract-based projects as described from the perspective of the lead supplier or prime contractor.

AB  - Automotive development faces tightening regulatory requirements, shortening development cycle times, and growing complexity. To cope with such an environment, it is moving from a traditional evolutionary to a systems engineering approach. Great effort is being made for a shift from the traditional component focus, which has been enhanced by concurrent engineering, to a more broadened view supported by systems thinking. This broader view, however, is in practice strongly focused on the product elements of the system. This paper proposes a systems engineering framework for integrated automotive development—the total view approach. It is a modeling framework that integrates the product, its life cycle processes and their associated organizations throughout the requirements, functional and physical analysis processes, at all levels of the product breakdown structure, deriving attributes as emergent properties of a whole integrated system. The paper justifies the framework through a review of traditional and current automotive development and two case studies. A major benefit of the application of the framework is the ability to investigate early in the product development process the interactions between requirements and attributes not only of the product, but also of its life cycle processes and their associated organisations. This can lead to better product quality, lower life cycle cost, shorter development time, and manageable complexity. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Syst Eng 7: 153–166, 2004

AB  - Systems Integration is an activity omnipresent in almost all of systems engineering and management. Often the term lacks precise definition and is used in different ways and for different purposes in the engineering of systems. This paper presents an overview of systems integration at all levels of system engineering and management. The goal of the paper is to present the various views of systems integration including lifecycle, architecture, process, interface, and enterprise, as well as product integration involving software and hardware. We examine systems engineering process, including several process models in an attempt to reveal the activities associated with integration during the engineering of systems. We review the characteristics of interfaces between systems of systems and users that generally give rise to many systems integration concerns. Without very careful effort at developing an appropriate architecture for a system, there will be little hope of integration. We discuss the role of systems management and knowledge integration in architecting for systems integration. Also presented are several contemporary perspectives on system architectures and their role in the engineering and integration of systems. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Syst Eng 1: 176–227, 1998

AB  - There exist the generic concepts and semantic relationships in the description of procedural knowledge and strategic knowledge in contract management. In order that contract information could be understood and processed by machine automatically, more semantic descriptions are needed. Ontology has become a promising technology to express semantics. At present, Web ontology languages have been standardized. However, building domain ontology based on OWL (Ontology Web Language) just begins and has a long way to go. In building domain ontology, people should explore the rationality in expressing domain concepts and relations between the concepts, considering the capabilities of OWL (not the capability of natural languages). In this paper, we put forward a framework of contract ontology after considering capabilities to express semantic relations provided by OWL. Then we use Prot?g?-2000 to build OWL representations of the contract ontology and make some analyses. Our exploration might not standardize contract ontology. We explore with the intention to help people better understand the rationality in expressing concepts and relations between the concepts in contract management in order that OWL contract ontology and other domain ontology are improved and standardized as soon as possible.

AB  - In this paper, we explore the concept of code readability and investigate its relation to software quality. With data collected from human annotators, we derive associations between a simple set of local code features and human notions of readability. Using those features, we construct an automated readability measure and show that it can be 80% effective, and better than a human on average, at predicting readability judgments. Furthermore, we show that this metric correlates strongly with two traditional measures of software quality, code changes and defect reports. Finally, we discuss the implications of this study on programming language design and engineering practice. For example, our data suggests that comments, in of themselves, are less important than simple blank lines to local judgments of readability.

The focus of the paper is on the semantic analysis of the textual amendment provisions and the formalized representation of the amendments in terms of meta-data. The proposed approach to consolidation is metadata--oriented and based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques: we use XML--based standards for metadata annotation of legislative acts and a flexible NLP architecture for extracting metadata from parsed texts. An evaluation of achieved results is also provided.

This approach has three facets: a technical facet, for “looking inside the black box”; an empirical facet, for assessing the system’s impact on performance; and a subjective facet, for obtaining users’ judgments about the system. Such an approach is required to test the system against the different types of criteria of interest to sponsors and users and is consistent with evolving lifecycle paradigms. Moreover, such an approach leads to the application of different evaluation methods to answer different types of evaluation questions. Different evaluation methods for each facet are overviewed.

To this end, a dialogue game model of the relevant parts of Dutch civil procedure is developed with three players: two adversaries and a judge. The model aims to be both legally realistic and technically well-founded. Legally, the main achievement is a more realistic account of the judge's role in legal procedures than that provided by current models. Technically, the model aims to preserve the features of an earlier-developed framework for two-player argumentative dialogue systems.

In the present paper we prove the hardness of the business process regulatory compliance problem by taking into account a sub-problem of the general problem. This limited problem allows to verify only the compliance of structured processes with respect to a regulatory framework composed of a set of conditional obligations including a deadline. Experimental evidence from existing studies shows that compliance is a difficult task. In this paper, despite considering a sub-problem of the general problem, we provide some theoretical evidence of the difficulty of the task. In particular we show that the source of the complexity lies in the core language of verifying conditional obligations with a deadline. We prove that for this simplified case verifying partial compliance belongs to the class of  NP -complete problems, and verifying full compliance belongs to the class of co NP -complete problems. Thus by proving the difficulty of a simplified compliance problem we prove that the general problem of verifying business process regulatory compliance is hard.

AB  - In this paper we discuss a hybrid approach combining Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) and Information Retrieval (IR) for the retrieval of full-text documents. Our hybrid CBR-IR approach takes as input a standard symbolic representation of a problem case and retrieves texts of relevant cases from a document collection dramatically larger than the case base available to the CBR system. Our system works by first performing a standard HYPO-style CBR analysis and then using the texts associated with certain important classes of cases found in this analysis to “seed” a modified version of INQUERY's relevance feedback mechanism in order to generate a query composed of individual terms or pairs of terms. Our approach provides two benefits: it extends the reach of CBR (for retrieval purposes) to much larger corpora, and it enables the injection of knowledge-based techniques into traditional IR. We describe our CBR-IR approach and report on on-going experiments.

AB  - This article presents an initial model of instructional design which directly links cognitive learning theory and instructional prescriptions. The major constructs of the model include components of the memory system, allocation of learning times by objectives and specific instructional methods. The model proposes that instructional time be divided so as to reach the educational goals of improvements in higher-order learning and thinking as well as knowledge acquisition. Integrating current methods of instructional strategies provides the framework for bridging the gap between cognitive learning theory and instructional design.

His writings cover a wide range of subjects and his influence can be seen in ethics, aesthetics, symbolic logic, religion, epistemology and metaphysics, and also scientific topics. The greater part of Peirce's papers were unpublished during his lifetime and upon his death several hundred manuscripts were left to Harvard University. This eight-volume collection also includes Peirce's writings on general philosophy, logic, pragmatism, metaphysics, experimental science, scientific method and philosophy of mind, as well as reviews and correspondence.

AB  - In designing software systems, security is typically only one design objective among many. It may compete with other objectives such as functionality, usability, and performance. Too often, security mechanisms such as firewalls, access control, or encryption are adopted without explicit recognition of competing design objectives and their origins in stakeholders' interests. Recently, there is increasing acknowledgement that security is ultimately about trade-offs. One can only aim for ''good enough'' security, given the competing demands from many parties. This paper investigates the criteria for a conceptual modeling technique for making security trade-offs. We examine how conceptual modeling can provide explicit and systematic support for modeling and analyzing security trade-offs. We examine several existing approaches for dealing with trade-offs and security trade-offs in particular. From analyzing the limitations of existing methods, we propose an extension to the i^* Framework for security trade-off analysis, taking advantage of its multi-agent and goal orientation. The method was applied to several case studies used to exemplify existing approaches. The resulting models developed using different approaches are compared.

AB  - Problems with legal quality will not only increase effort and costs of the law enforcement organisations, but also undermines the regulating power of the legislator. Unintended use or even abuse of the law may be the result. Governments therefore should improve their legal quality. The complexity of legislation however makes this task a hard one. The Dutch Tax and Customs Administration (DTCA in Dutch: Belastingdienst) has developed a method and supporting tools that support a systematic translation of (new) legislation into the DTCA's processes. This POWER-method and tools help to improve the quality of (new) legislation and codify the knowledge used in the translation processes in which legislation and regulations are transformed into procedures, computer programs and other designs. Thereby the time-to-market of the implementation of legislation will be reduced. In this article we explain some knowledge representation techniques that we use to improve legal quality. We will also show its application and give real-life examples of anomalies detected. In contrast to other knowledge modelling approaches the POWER-approach is focused on modelling legal sources rather than expert knowledge. Expert knowledge however is still needed to find the correct interpretations but also for efficiency reasons. Starting with representing the (legal) experts' knowledge (using scenarios) helps us to find the adequate scope (the legal sources to be analysed). Confronting the expert with differences between the model build out of the experts' knowledge and the ones we make out of the other knowledge sources (specifically the law) causes the legal experts to see things in a different light and has often led to changes in the law.

AB  - The research described here explores the idea of using Supreme Court oral arguments as pedagogical examples in first year classes to help students learn the role of hypothetical reasoning in law. The article presents examples of patterns of reasoning with hypotheticals in appellate legal argument and in the legal classroom and a process model of hypothetical reasoning that relates them to work in cognitive science and Artificial Intelligence. The process model describes the relationships between an advocate's proposed test for deciding a case or issue, the facts of the hypothetical and of the case to be decided, and the often conflicting legal principles and policies underlying the issue. The process model of hypothetical reasoning has been partially implemented in a computerized teaching environment, LARGO ("Legal ARgument Graph Observer") that helps students identify, analyze, and reflect on episodes of hypothetical reasoning in oral argument transcripts. Using LARGO, students reconstruct examples of hypothetical reasoning in the oral arguments by representing them in simple diagrams that focus students on the proposed test, the hypothetical challenge to the test, and the responses to the challenge. The program analyzes the diagrams and provides feedback to help students complete the diagrams and reflect on the significance of the hypothetical reasoning in the argument. The article reports the results of experiments evaluating instruction of first year law students at the University of Pittsburgh using the LARGO program as applied to Supreme Court personal jurisdiction cases. The learning results so far have been mixed. Instruction with LARGO has been shown to help law student volunteers with lower LSAT scores learn skills and knowledge regarding hypothetical reasoning better than a text-based approach, but not when the students were required to participate. On the other hand, the diagrams students produce with LARGO have been shown to have some diagnostic value, distinguishing among law students on the basis of LSAT scores, posttest performance, and years in law school. This lends support to the underlying model of hypothetical argument and suggests using LARGO as a pedagogically diagnostic tool.

AB  - Enabling Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to formulate knowledge without the intervention of Knowledge Engineers (KEs) requires providing SMEs with methods and tools that abstract the underlying knowledge representation and allow them to focus on modeling activities. Bridging the gap between SME-authored models and their representation is challenging, especially in the case of complex knowledge types like processes, where aspects like frame management, data, and control flow need to be addressed. In this paper, we describe how SME-authored process models can be provided with an operational semantics and grounded in a knowledge representation language like F-logic to support process-related reasoning. The main results of this work include a formalism for process representation and a mechanism for automatically translating process diagrams into executable code following such formalism. From all the process models authored by SMEs during evaluation 82 percent were well formed, all of which executed correctly. Additionally, the two optimizations applied to the code generation mechanism produced a performance improvement at reasoning time of 25 and 30 percent with respect to the base case, respectively.

AB  - In the United States, organizations can be held liable by the Federal Trade Commission for the statements they make in their privacy policies. Thus, organizations must include their privacy policies as a source of requirements in order to build systems that are policy-compliant. In this paper, we describe an empirical user study in which we measure the ability of requirements engineers to effectively extract compliance requirements from a privacy policy using one of three analysis approaches—CPR (commitment, privilege, and right) analysis, goal-based analysis, and non-methodassisted (control) analysis. The results of these three approaches were then compared to an expert-produced set of expected compliance requirements. The requirements extracted by the CPR subjects reflected a higher percentage of requirements that were expected compliance requirements as well as a higher percentage of the total expected compliance requirements. In contrast, the goal-based and control subjects produced a higher number of synthesized requirements, or requirements not directly derived from the policy than the CPR subjects. This larger number of synthesized requirements may be attributed to the fact that these two subject groups employed more inquiry-driven approaches than the CPR subjects who relied primarily on focused and direct extraction of compliance requirements.

AB  - In this article the argumentation structure of the court's decision in the Popov v. Hayashi case is formalised in Prakken's (Argument Comput 1:93---124; 2010) abstract framework for argument-based inference with structured arguments. In this framework, arguments are inference trees formed by applying two kinds of inference rules, strict and defeasible rules. Arguments can be attacked in three ways: attacking a premise, attacking a conclusion and attacking an inference. To resolve such conflicts, preferences may be used, which leads to three corresponding kinds of defeat, after which Dung's (Artif Intell 77:321---357; 1995) abstract acceptability semantics can be used to evaluate the arguments. In the present paper the abstract framework is instantiated with strict inference rules corresponding to first-order logic and with defeasible inference rules for defeasible modus ponens and various argument schemes. The main techniques used in the formal reconstruction of the case are rule-exception structures and arguments about rule validity. Arguments about socio-legal values and the use of precedent cases are reduced to arguments about rule validity. The tree structure of arguments, with explicit subargument relations between arguments, is used to capture the dependency relations between the elements of the court's decision.

AB  - Though very important in software engineering, linking artifacts of the same type (clone detection) or of different types (traceability recovery) is extremely tedious, error-prone and requires significant effort. Past research focused on supporting analysts with mechanisms based on Natural Language Processing (NLP) to identify candidate links. Because a plethora of NLP techniques exists, and their performances vary among contexts, it is important to characterize them according to the provided level of support. The aim of this paper is to characterize a comprehensive set of NLP techniques according to the provided level of support to human analysts in detecting equivalent requirements. The characterization consists on a case study, featuring real requirements, in the context of an Italian company in the defense and aerospace domain. The major result from the case study is that simple NLP are more precise than complex ones.

AB  - Transport Canada is reviewing its Aviation Security regulations in a multi-year modernization process. As part of this review, consideration is given to transitioning regulations where appropriate from a prescriptive style to an outcome-based style. This raises new technical and cultural challenges related to how to measure compliance. This paper reports on a novel approach used to model regulations with the Goal-oriented Requirement Language, augmented with qualitative indicators. These models are used to guide the generation of questions for inspection activities, enable a flexible conversion of real-world data into goal satisfaction levels, and facilitate compliance analysis. A new propagation mechanism enables the evaluation of the compliance level of an organization. This outcome-based approach is expected to help get a more precise understanding of who complies with what, while highlighting opportunities for improving existing regulatory elements.

AB  - Abstract   Context  Critical systems in domains such as aviation, railway, and automotive are often subject to a formal process of safety certification. The goal of this process is to ensure that these systems will operate safely without posing undue risks to the user, the public, or the environment. Safety is typically ensured via complying with safety standards. Demonstrating compliance to these standards involves providing evidence to show that the safety criteria of the standards are met.    Objective  In order to cope with the complexity of large critical systems and subsequently the plethora of evidence information required for achieving compliance, safety professionals need in-depth knowledge to assist them in classifying different types of evidence, and in structuring and assessing the evidence. This paper is a step towards developing such a body of knowledge that is derived from a large-scale empirically rigorous literature review.    Method  We use a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) as the basis for our work. The SLR builds on 218 peer-reviewed studies, selected through a multi-stage process, from 4963 studies published between 1990 and 2012.    Results  We develop a taxonomy that classifies the information and artefacts considered as evidence for safety. We review the existing techniques for safety evidence structuring and assessment, and further study the relevant challenges that have been the target of investigation in the academic literature. We analyse commonalities in the results among different application domains and discuss implications of the results for both research and practice.    Conclusion  The paper is, to our knowledge, the largest existing study on the topic of safety evidence. The results are particularly relevant to practitioners seeking a better grasp on evidence requirements as well as to researchers in the area of system safety. As a major finding of the review, the results strongly suggest the need for more practitioner-oriented and industry-driven empirical studies in the area of safety certification.

AB  - Although most of the work on Artificial Intelligence and Law today is oriented towards the development of pract ical systems, there is a small group of researchers who are primarily interested in theoretical questions: How much of legal reasoning can be reduced to reasoning wit h rules? Is this rule-based component significant, or trivial? How is it possible to rewon with cases at all? Are legal concepts just like ordinary common sense concepts, or do they have special characteristics? Is it possible to develop a computational theory of legal argument? The researchers who have investigated these questions include: Anne Gardner [1 I]; Edwina Rissland and her students, Kevin Ashley [38, 1] and David Skalak [39, 41]; Michael Dyer and his student, Seth Goldman [12]; Karl Branting [5]; and Keith Bellairs [2], In addition, researchers such as Richard Susskind [45] and J .C. Smith [43], who have primarily built practical systems, have also been deeply concerned with the jurisprudential foundations of the field.

AB  - A crucial aspect of evidential reasoning in crime investigation involves comparing the support that evidence provides for alternative hypotheses. Recent work in forensic statistics has shown how Bayesian Networks (BNs) can be employed for this purpose. However, the specification of BNs requires conditional probability tables describing the uncertain processes under evaluation. When these processes are poorly understood, it is necessary to rely on subjective probabilities provided by experts. Accurate probabilities of this type are normally hard to acquire from experts. Recent work in qualitative reasoning has developed methods to perform probabilistic reasoning using coarser representations. However, the latter types of approaches are too imprecise to compare the likelihood of alternative hypotheses. This paper examines this shortcoming of the qualitative approaches when applied to the aforementioned problem, and identifies and integrates techniques to refine them.

AB  - Information systems governed by laws and regulations are subject to civil and criminal violations. In the United States, these violations are documented in court records, such as complaints, indictments, plea agreements, and verdicts, which thus constitute a source of real-world software vulnerabilities. This paper reports on an exploratory case study to identify legal vulnerabilities and provides guidance to practitioners in the analysis of court documents. As legal violations occur after system deployment, court records reveal vulnerabilities that were likely overlooked during software development. We evaluate established requirements engineering techniques, including sequence and misuse case diagrams and goal models, as applied to criminal court records to identify mitigating requirements that improve privacy protections. These techniques, when properly applied, can help organizations focus their risk-management efforts on emerging legal vulnerabilities. We illustrate our analysis using criminal indictments involving the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).

AB  - The author describes five separate projects he has undertaken in the intersection of computer science and Canadian income tax law. They are:   A computer-assisted instruction (CAI) course for teaching income tax, programmed using conventional CAI techniques;    A “document modeling” computer program for generating the documentation for a tax-based transaction and advising the lawyer-user as to what decisions should be made and what the tax effects will be, programmed in a conventional language;    A prototype expert system for determining the income tax effects of transactions and tax-defined relationships, based on a PROLOG representation of the rules of the Income Tax Act;    An intelligent CAI (ICAI) system for generating infinite numbers of randomized quiz questions for students, computing the answers, and matching wrong answers to particular student errors, based on a PROLOG representation of the rules of the Income Tax Act; and    A Hypercard stack for providing information about income tax, enabling both education and practical research to follow the user's needs path.     The author shows that non-AI approaches are a way to produce packages quickly and efficiently. Their primary disadvantage is the massive rewriting required when the tax law changes. AI approaches based on PROLOG, on the other hand, are harder to develop to a practical level but will be easier to audit and maintain. The relationship between expert systems and CAI is discussed.

We describe some experiments with judgments of the House of Lords: we have performed automatic linguistic annotation of a small sample set and then hand-annotated the sentences in the set in order to explore the relationship between linguistic features and argumentative roles. We use state-of-the-art NLP techniques to perform the linguistic annotation using XML-based tools and a combination of rule-based and statistical methods. We focus here on the predictive capacity of tense and aspect features for a classifier.

AB  - This paper explores how to extract argumentation-relevant information automatically from a corpus of legal decision documents, and how to build new arguments using that information. For decision texts, we use the Vaccine/Injury Project (V/IP) Corpus, which contains default-logic annotations of argument structure. We supplement this with presuppositional annotations about entities, events, and relations that play important roles in argumentation, and about the level of confidence that arguments would be successful. We then propose how to integrate these semantic-pragmatic annotations with syntactic and domain-general semantic annotations, such as those generated in the DeepQA architecture, and outline how to apply machine learning and scoring techniques similar to those used in the IBM Watson system for playing the Jeopardy! question-answer game. We replace this game-playing goal, however, with the goal of learning to construct legal arguments.

AB  - This paper investigates the appropriateness of formal dialectics as a basis for nonmonotonic reasoning and defeasible reasoning that takes computational limits seriously. Rules that can come into conflict should be regarded as policies, which are inputs to deliberative processes. Dialectical protocols are appropriate for such deliberations when resources are bounded and search is serial.



AI, it is claimed here, is now perfectly positioned to correct many misconceptions about reasoning that have resulted from mathematical logic's enormous success in this century: among them, (1) that all reasons are demonstrative, (2) that rational belief is constrained, not constructed, and (3) that process and disputation are not essential to reasoning. AI mainly provides new impetus to formalize the alternative (but older) conception of reasoning, and AI provides mechanisms with which to create compelling formalism that describes the control of processes.



The technical contributions here are: the partial justification of dialectic based on controlling search; the observation that nonmonotonic reasoning can be subsumed under certain kinds of dialectics; the portrayal of inference in knowledge bases as policy reasoning; the review of logics of dialogue and proposed extensions; and the preformal and initial formal discussion of aspects and variations of dialectical systems with nondemonstrative reasons.

AB  - We assume, in contrast to many legal realists, that law is a part of reality. Law exists because people believe in law, but law is not identical with beliefs. Law supervenes on human beliefs, preferences, actions, dispositions and artefacts. Moreover, the morally binding personal interpretation of the law supervenes on two things together: on the individual?s knowledge of legal institutions and on moral obligation. The first supervenes in its turn on mutual beliefs; the second supervenes on motivations and dispositions of the individual, provided that she is morally sensitive and rational. Personal interpretation of law converts into social law, if other persons on the basis of overriding reasons do not contest it. Morally binding social law supervenes on moral motivation that is triggered by institutions that supervene on mutual beliefs.

AB  - Defeasible logic is a nonmonotonic reasoning approach based on rules and priorities. Its design supports efficient implementation, and it shows promise to be deployed successfully in applications. So far, only static priorities have been used, provided by an external superiority relation. In this article we show how dynamic priorities can be integrated, where priority information is obtained from the deductive process itself. Dynamic priorities have been studied for other related reasoning systems such as default logic and argumentation. We define a proof theory, study its formal properties, and provide an argumentation semantics. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Empirical research on basic components of American judicial opinions has only scratched the surface. Lack of a coordinated pool of legal experts or adequate computational resources are but two reasons responsible for this deficiency. We have undertaken a study to uncover fundamental components of judicial opinions found in American case law. The study was aided by a team of twelve expert attorney-editors with a combined total of 135 years of legal editing experience. The scientific hypothesis underlying the experiment was that after years of working closely with thousands of judicial opinions, expert attorneys would develop a refined and internalized schema of the content and structure of legal cases. In this study participants were permitted to describe both concept-related and format-related components. The resultant components, representing a combination of these two broad categories, are reported on in this paper. Additional experiments are currently under way which further validated and refine this set of components and apply them to new search paradigms.

Danger-aware system is a kind of context awareness system, which detects the dangerous situations and provides services responsive to the dangerous situation. However, there is a shortcoming in the current danger/context awareness systems that the reasoning mechanisms are not flexible. Without enough predefined contexts, the system cannot work well, e.g., if a detected context is similar to a predefined context, but not exactly same as the predefined one, the system cannot recognize it.

In particular, this survey deals with those investigations that examine multiple versions of software artifacts or other temporal information. A taxonomy is derived from the analysis of this literature and presents the work via four dimensions: the type of software repositories mined (what), the purpose (why), the adopted/invented methodology used (how), and the evaluation method (quality). The taxonomy is demonstrated to be expressive (i.e., capable of representing a wide spectrum of MSR investigations) and effective (i.e., facilitates similarities and comparisons of MSR investigations). Lastly, a number of open research issues in MSR that require further investigation are identified.

AB  - Infrastructure management refers to the ongoing body of knowledge associated with the management of economic infrastructure such as power, water, sewerage, gas, communications and transportation systems, and social infrastructure such as hospitals, schools, etc. The purpose of this paper is to provide an insight into the way infrastructure management is changing as a result of the increasing complexity caused by technical, economic, managerial, environmental, political, and social factors. Due to this complexity, traditional engineering management approaches for infrastructure systems are no longer effective in meeting the needs of the stakeholders, including the public at large. This paper proposes that the new direction for infrastructure management should be driven by the body of knowledge associated with development of systems and the management of existing systems (i.e., Systems Engineering/Asset Management). It begins by examining the issues that are important when developing any new engineering management system. It introduces the concept of systems thinking and suggests how a holistic vision can provide an insight into the significant relationships that need to be considered when developing management approaches for infrastructure. It discusses evolving engineering management approaches and how they relate to the changing environment. The paper concludes by suggesting that the adoption of a holistic approach to infrastructure management is the key to managing the increasingly complex interrelationships and will overcome many of the deficiencies in the traditional approaches. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - This paper presents a theory of reasoning with evidence in order to determine the facts in a criminal case. The focus is on the process of proof, in which the facts of the case are determined, rather than on related legal issues, such as the admissibility of evidence. In the literature, two approaches to reasoning with evidence can be distinguished, one argument-based and one story-based. In an argument-based approach to reasoning with evidence, the reasons for and against the occurrence of an event, e.g., based on witness testimony, are central. In a story-based approach, evidence is evaluated and interpreted from the perspective of the factual stories as they may have occurred in a case, e.g., as they are defended by the prosecution. In this paper, we argue that both arguments and narratives are relevant and useful in the reasoning with and interpretation of evidence. Therefore, a hybrid-approach is proposed and formally developed, doing justice to both the argument-based and the narrative-based perspective. By the formalization of the theory and the associated graphical representations, our proposal is the basis for the design of software developed as a tool to make sense of the evidence in complex cases.

They are “wicked” problems, whereas science has developed to deal with “tame” problems. Policy problems cannot be definitively described. Moreover, in a pluralistic society there is nothing like the undisputable public good; there is no objective definition of equity; policies that respond to social problems cannot be meaningfully correct or false; and it makes no sense to talk about “optimal solutions” to social problems unless severe qualifications are imposed first. Even worse, there are no “solutions” in the sense of definitive and objective answers.

Two main formal approaches to coherence are examined: coherence-based models of belief revision and the theory of coherence as constraint satisfaction. It is shown that these approaches shed light on central aspects of a coherentist legal epistemology, such as the concept of coherence, the dynamics of coherentist justification in law, and the mechanisms whereby coherence may be built in the course of legal decision-making.

AB  - This paper reviews the history of AI & Law research from the perspective of argument schemes. It starts with the observation that logic, although very well applicable to legal reasoning when there is uncertainty, vagueness and disagreement, is too abstract to give a fully satisfactory classification of legal argument types. It therefore needs to be supplemented with an argument-scheme approach, which classifies arguments not according to their logical form but according to their content, in particular, according to the roles that the various elements of an argument can play. This approach is then applied to legal reasoning, to identify some of the main legal argument schemes. It is also argued that much AI & Law research in fact employs the argument-scheme approach, although it usually is not presented as such. Finally, it is argued that the argument-scheme approach and the way it has been employed in AI & Law respects some of the main lessons to be learnt from Toulmin’s The Uses of Argument.

AB  - Summary form only given. Software security has come a long way in the last few years, but we've really only just begun. I will present a detailed approach to getting past theory and putting software security into practice. The three pillars of software security are applied risk management, software security best practices (which I call touchpoints), and knowledge. By describing a manageably small set of touchpoints based around the software artifacts that you already produce, I avoid religious warfare over process and get on with the business of software security. That means you can adopt the touchpoints without radically changing the way you work. The touchpoints I will describe include: code review using static analysis tools; architectural risk analysis; penetration testing; security testing; abuse case development; and security requirements. Like the yin and the yang, software security requires a careful balance-attack and defense, exploiting and designing, breaking and building-bound into a coherent package. Create your own Security Development Lifecycle by enhancing your existing software development lifecycle with the touchpoints

AB  - This paper presents a visual framework for modelling complex legal reasoning-reasoning that integrates legal rules and policies with expert and non-expert evidence. The framework is based on a many-valued, predicate, default logic. The paper first visualizes the two sides of the rule-evidence interface: rule-based deductions and evidence evaluation. It then explores ways to visualize several dynamics around that interface, including dynamics concerning evidentiary relevance, findings of fact, process decision making about motions, policy-based reasoning about rules and relevant-factor reasoning. The paper then concludes with visualizing dynamics across multiple cases and briefly discusses one pathway by which new legal rules might emerge from the factfinding process. The paper therefore presents a visual working environment for people who litigate or decide actual cases, who study judicial or administrative reasoning or who teach law.

AB  - Since the famous statement "What is not measurable make measurable" of Galileo Galilei (1564 - 1642) it has been a major goal in science to quantify observations as a way to understand and control the underlying causes. With the growing awareness that evolution is a key aspect of software, an increasing number of computer scientists is investigating how metrics can be applied to evolving software artifacts. This paper provides a classification of the various approaches that use metrics to analyse, understand, control and improve the software evolution process, and identifies topics that require further research. As such, we expect that this paper will stimulate this emerging research area.

AB  - In recent years compliance has emerged as one of the big IT challenges enterprises are faced with. The management of a multitude of regulations and the complexity of current business processes are problems that need to be addressed.

In this paper we present an approach based on so-called compliance templates to develop and manage compliant business processes involving different stakeholders.

We introduce the concept of a refinement process. In the refinement process each compliance template is refined in a layered way to get an executable business process. The refinement steps are executed on refinement layers by different stakeholders. Compliance constraints are used to restrict the way a compliance template can be refined. Introduced in a certain refinement layer of the refinement process, compliance constraints are propagated to higher refinement layers.

AB  - Conflict situations do not only arise from misunderstandings, erroneous perceptions, partial knowledge, false beliefs, etc., but also from differences in “opinions” and in the different agents' value systems. It is not always possible, and maybe not even desirable, to “solve” this kind of conflict, as the sources are subjective. The communicating agents can, however, use knowledge of the opponent's preferences, to try and convince the partner of a point of view which they wish to promote. To deal with these situations requires an argumentative capacity, able to handle not only “demonstrative” arguments but also “dialectic” ones, which may not necessarily be based on rationality and valid premises. This paper presents a formalization of a theory of informal argumentation, focused on techniques to change attitudes of the interlocutor, in the domain of health promotion.

AB  - HAPPY New Year. It has been exactly one year since I started as Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE), so in this editorial I would like to refl ect on to refl ect on this last year and to share with you some facts and fi gures and my plans for the next year. In my fi rst editorial last January, I suggested three medium term goals for the journals that I reiterate below and which I believe still hold: 1. To reemphasize the broad scope of the journal, encouraging the publication of multidisciplinary research as well as specialization in software engineering. 2. To engage with the software engineering community at large, including other journals, about the software engineering discipline, using not only the journal itself as a forum but through other professional outlets such as conferences and the Web. 3. To support a debate on the nature of scholarly discourse in software engineering, such as the kind and length of papers published in the journal, or the different forms of peer review and discussion around what is published. My fi rst goal above is rather subtle. The scope of the journal is already quite precisely defi ned and has not changed for some time. However, I still believe that as software—and software engineering—continues to permeate society and the development of systems of all kinds, software engineering research also has opportunities to grow. To grow in terms of its interaction with other disciplines outside its traditional boundaries, but also to grow it terms of specialization within, say, problem domain boundaries. To this end, I have encouraged the TSE editorial board to help solicit a broader range of submissions, but also to handle submissions outside TSE’s traditional boundaries with tolerance, even enthusiasm. This sometimes means making an additional effort to guide authors to formulate or reformulate submissions to make the work more accessible to a software engineering audience. The impact of this approach will take some time to have a visible effect, as most of the papers submitted to TSE in 2010 have yet to be published. With respect to my second goal above, community engagement is an ongoing effort. In 2010 I met with the editorsin-chief of many of the software engineering research journals, and we discussed ways in which we can help present research that is novel and exciting, that is rigorous and well-presented, and that is relevant and useful to readers of our publications. I have encouraged, but only been partially successful, in engaging TSE readers to contribute to the debate about the discipline of software engineering. I say “partially successful” because there has been almost no discussion on the TSE electronic forum, but I have received many individual e-mails from readers addressing very specifi c issues, such as those that I raise in my regular editorials. It does seem that an open ended invitation to discuss the discipline is too vague to engage most readers, and so I will continue to discuss specifi c topics in each issue of the journal. The third goal above is one that has been receiving attention from other journal and magazine editors as well. I do sense that the value of journal publications in software engineering is back on the rise, and I feel that my appeal to authors to submit different kinds (and lengths) of manuscripts is being addressed. I have said previously that there is nothing sacred about the kind and length of a software engineering research contribution, and in the last year TSE received more short and a few very long manuscripts. In all cases, I have asked associate editors to consider if content justifi es the length, rather than be distracted by any notion of suggested manuscript length. Papers published in 2011 will be partly the result of such an approach. What else have I learned from year 1? Well, personally, I have been saddened to observe that much of my time is spent handling exceptions of the rather unpleasant variety—plagiarism, duplicate or overlapping submissions, and, in a few cases, appeals. I have absolutely no problem at all with appeals. Authors should feel free to question review decisions on their papers—the review process is not infallible—and queries or complaints help test the robustness of the process and the resultant decisions. Similarly, I encourage readers to write and question or discuss published papers’ content. Some readers have chosen to do this anonymously and that’s fi ne, although I would welcome more open technical commentaries, which TSE has the mechanism to publish in hardcopy or in the digital library. What does bother me are the incidents of what can only be termed unethical behavior—such as plagiarism. The penalties for this are severe, and a “prohibited authors” list is updated and circulated among all IEEE editors each month, with each additional named author fully investigated before being “blacklisted” and barred from future submission to the journal. Incidence of self-plagiarism or duplicate submissions are equally troubling, and a real time drain for editors and reviewers. In a future editorial, I will also discuss the undesirable phenomenon of an LPU—a “least publishable unit”—which unfortunately seems be a way for some authors to increase their publication counts by publishing very small incremental contributions over previously published work. Duplicate or heavily overlapping submissions are often detected, due to the limited and specialized community of reviewers and the open and interactive relationships between journal editors.

AB  - This article outlines criteria for the evaluation of the argumentum ad hominem (argument against the person, or personal attack in argument) that is traditionally a part of the curriculum in informal logic. The argument is shown to be a kind of criticism which works by shifting the burden of proof in dialogue through citing a pragmatic inconsistency in an arguer's position. Several specific cases of ad hominem argumentation which pose interesting problems in analyzing this type of criticism are studied.

AB  - Our work presents an approach to automatic detection of potentially redundant elements within an Enterprise Architecture (EA). Unintended or unidentified redundancies can affect the data quality, duplicating efforts which may lead to inconsistencies. Evaluating and identifying manually redundant elements in large information systems (IS) is a tedious, error-prone and time-consuming task. Untimely, incomplete or inaccurate analysis, could affect the dynamics and organizational flexibility that promotes an EA. Our proposal is a MDA (Model-Driven Architecture) and Ontology-Alignment based. The main idea is to perform a transformation from an EA model towards ontology in OWL format (Ontology Web Language) and exploit ontology matching tools to infer correspondences between concepts. Our objective is to support analysis and making decisions of architect with an integral view which describes EAs data and processes, and its inner relationships.

AB  - In the past decades the world has been changing in almost every aspect. Systems development is facing rapidly changing and increasingly global environments in markets, competition, technology, regulatory, and societal systems. Systems to be delivered must be designed not only to meet customer or market needs, but also increasingly to meet requirements and constraints of systems sharing its operational context and throughout their entire lifecycle. The design of a system must provide for a continuous evolution of its architecture either by upgrading a system already in service or releasing a new version or derivative. Based on these key challenges imposed on development systems, this paper will evolve the idea of incorporating changeability into a system architecture. Flexibility, agility, robustness, and adaptability as four key aspects of changeability will be defined and described. Design principles to enable flexibility, agility, robustness, and adaptability within systems are proposed and described. A basic approach outlining and guiding an application of the framework described concludes this paper. Examples from varying industries will illustrate the applicability and implementation of selected principles. Thus this paper spans a view from why, when, and how changeability has to be incorporated into a system's architecture. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Syst Eng 8: 342–359, 2005

AB  - A discussion is presented of the two primary ways of understanding software costs. The black-box or influence-function approach provides useful experimental and observational insights on the relative software productivity and quality leverage of various management, technical, environmental, and personnel options. The glass-box or cost distribution approach helps identify strategies for integrated software productivity and quality improvement programs using such structures as the value chain and the software productivity opportunity tree. The individual strategies for improving software productivity are identified. Issues related to software costs and controlling them are examined and discussed. It is pointed out that a good framework of techniques exists for controlling software budgets, schedules, and work completed, but that a great deal of further progress is needed to provide an overall set of planning and control techniques covering software product qualities and end-user system objectives. >

AB  - Developing software systems that meet stakeholders' needs and expectations is the ultimate goal of any software provider seeking a competitive edge. To achieve this, you must effectively and accurately manage your stakeholders' system requirements: the features, functions, and attributes they need in their software system. Once you agree on these requirements, you can use them as a focal point for the development process and produce a software system that meets the expectations of both customers and users. However, in real world software development, there are usually more requirements than you can implement given stakeholders' time and resource constraints. Thus, project managers face a dilemma: how do you select a subset of the customers' requirements and still produce a system that meets their needs? The authors developed a cost-value approach for prioritizing requirements and applied it to two commercial projects.

AB  - Model-Driven Development (MDD) emphasizes the use of models at a higher abstraction level in the software development process and argues in favor of automation via model execution, transformation, and code generation. However, one current challenge is how to manage requirements during this process whilst simultaneously stressing the benefits of automation. This paper presents a systematic review of the current use of requirements engineering techniques in MDD processes and their actual automation level. 72 papers from the last decade have been reviewed from an initial set of 884 papers. The results show that although MDD techniques are used to a great extent in platform-independent models, platform-specific models, and at code level, at the requirements level most MDD approaches use only partially defined requirements models or even natural language. We additionally identify several research gaps such as a need for more efforts to explicitly deal with requirements traceability and the provision of better tool support.

AB  - Current argumentation support software often employs graphical representations of logical relationships. Little is known about the extent to which logical structuring helps to increase a user's task performance. In this research, various levels of graphical representation of the logical structure of legal subject matter are experimentally compared in terms of performance. It is shown that logical structuring significantly increases task performance, but we have found no evidence that the extensive representation of logical structure as employed by several contemporary software applications is more effective or usable than a simplified graphical representation that was previously implemented in an application called ArguGuide.

AB  - Regulatory compliance of business operations is a critical problem for enterprises. As enterprises increasingly use business process management systems to automate their business processes, technologies to automatically check the compliance of process models against compliance rules are becoming important. In this paper, we present a method to improve the reliability and minimize the risk of failure of business process management systems from a compliance perspective. The proposed method allows separate modeling of both process models and compliance concerns. Business process models expressed in the Business Process Execution Language are transformed into pi-calculus and then into finite state machines. Compliance rules captured in the graphical Business Property Specification Language are translated into linear temporal logic. Thus, process models can be verified against these compliance rules by means of model-checking technology. The benefit of our method is threefold: Through the automated verification of a large set of business process models, our approach increases deployment efficiency and lowers the risk of installing noncompliant processes; it reduces the cost associated with inspecting business process models for compliance; and compliance checking may ensure compliance of new process models before their execution and thereby increase the reliability of business operations in general.

AB  - Scenario based approaches are becoming ubiquitous in systems analysis and design but remain vague in definition and scope. A survey of current practices indicates we must offer better means for structuring, managing, and developing their use in diverse contexts. The European Esprit project Crews (Cooperative Requirements Engineering with Scenarios) are seeking a deeper understanding of scenario diversity, necessary to improve methodological and tool support for scenario based requirements engineering. They follow a two pronged strategy to gain this understanding. First, following the "3 dimensions" requirements engineering framework developed in the precursor Nature project (K. Pohl, 1994), they developed a scenario classification framework based on a comprehensive survey of scenario literature in requirements engineering, human computer interaction, and other fields. They used the framework to classify 11 prominent scenario based approaches. Secondly, to complement this research framework, they investigated scenario applications in industrial projects through site visits with scenario user projects. The article focuses on these site visits. It was found that while many companies express interest in Jacobson's use case approach, actual scenario usage often falls outside what is described in textbooks and standard methodologies. Users therefore face significant scenario management problems not yet addressed adequately in theory or practice, and are demanding solutions to these problems.

AB  - The article investigates the interplay of moral rules in computer simulation. The investigation is based on two situations which are well-known to game theory: the prisoner's dilemma and the game of Chicken. The prisoner's dilemma can be taken to represent contractual situations, the game of Chicken represents a competitive situation on the one hand and the provision for a common good on the other. Unlike the rules usually used in game theory, each player knows the other's strategy. In that way, ever higher levels of reflection are reached reciprocally. Such strategies can be interpreted as ‘moral’ rules.

AB  - It is believed that the effectiveness of requirements engineering activities depends at least partially on the individuals involved. One of the factors that seems to influence an individual's effectiveness in requirements engineering activities is knowledge of the problem being solved, i.e., domain knowledge. While a requirements engineer's having in-depth domain knowledge helps him or her to understand the problem easier, he or she can fall for tacit assumptions of the domain and might overlook issues that are obvious to domain experts. This paper describes a controlled experiment to test the hypothesis that adding to a requirements elicitation team for a computer-based system in a particular domain, requirements analysts that are ignorant of the domain improves the effectiveness of the requirements elicitation team. The results, although not conclusive, show some support for accepting the hypothesis. The results were analyzed also to determine the effect of creativity, industrial experience, and requirements engineering experience. The results suggest other hypotheses to be studied in the future.

AB  - Goal- and agent-oriented models have become a consolidated type of artifact in various software and knowledge engineering activities. Several languages exist for representing such type of models but there is a lack of associated methodologies for guiding their construction up to the necessary level of detail. In this paper we present RiSD, a method for building Strategic Dependency (SD) models in the i* notation. RiSD is defined in a prescriptive way to reduce uncertainness when constructing the model. RiSD tackles three fundamental issues: (1) it tends to reduce the average size of the resulting models; (2) it defines some traceability relationships among model elements; (3) it provides some lexical and syntactical conventions. As a result, we may say that RiSD supports the construction process of goal- and agent-oriented models whilst increasing their understanding.

AB  - In recent years dialectics has become popular in Artificial Intelligence and law. A sub-branch of this field concentrates on the development of dialogue games. Many of these legal dialogue systems are fairly simple, in some respects even too simple. Among the topics dialogue games can improve on, is the division of the burden of proof. In this paper I discuss some legal dialogue games in the light of an actual legal procedure to show the shortcomings of these models. The paper shows what computational dialectics can learn form legal practice.

AB  - Summary

This paper outlines a three-part analysis of the traditional informal fallacy of ad ignorantiam. As initially characterized, the fallacy consists in arguing that failure to prove falsity (truth) implies the truth (falsity) of a proposition.



First, the fallacy is located within confirmation theory as a confusion between the categories of “lack of confirming evidence” and “presence of disconfirming evidence”. Second, the structure of the fallacy can be seen as an illicit negation shift in Hintikka-style epistemic logic. Third, the fallacy can be studied as an attempt to unfairly shift the burden of proof in a dialectical game. We suggest that research on ad ignorantiam needs a broadening of the scope of philosophical logic to encompass concepts of correct argument in these three contexts.

Resume

Cet article propose une analyse en trois parties du sophisme informel traditionnel ad ignorantiam. Sous sa forme originale, celui-ci consiste a argumenter que l'absence de preuve de la faussete (verite) implique la verite (faussete) d'une proposition.



1
Dans le cadre de la theorie de la confirmation, le sophisme apparait comme une confusion entre les categories absence de confirmation experimentale et presence d'infirmation experimentale.

2
Dans le cadre d'une logique epistemique style Hintikka, la structure du sophisme peut etre consideree comme un passage illicite a la negation.

3
Dans un jeu dialectique, le sophisme peut etre presente comme une tentative deloyale pour rejeter sur l'autre la charge de la preuve.





Nous pensons que cette recherche sur le sophisme ad ignorantiam exige un elargissement du domaine de la logique philosophique de maniere a ce qu'elle puisse assurer une argumentation correcte dans ces trois contextes.

Zusammenfassung

Es wird eine dreiteilige Analyse des traditionellen Fehlschlusses ad ignorantiam vorgelegt. Wie eingangs gezeigt wird, besteht der Fehlschluss darin, dass vom Misslingen, die Falschheit eines Satzes zu beweisen, auf seine Wahrheit geschlossen wird.



Erstens wird der Fehlschluss im Rahmen der Bewahrungstehorie als Folge einer Verwechslung zwischen den beiden Kategorien des Mangels an Bewahrungsinstanzenund des Vorhandenseins von Bewahrungsinstanzendargestellt. Zweitens kann die Struktur des Fehlschlusses als eine unzulassige Negationsverschiebung im Sinne von Hintikkas epistemischer Logik betrachtet werden. Drittens kann der Fehlschluss als Versuch gedeutet werden, die Beweislast in einem dialektischen Spiel in unfairer Weise auf den Gegner abzuschieben.



Es wird nahegelegt, dass die Erforschung dieses Problems eine Erweiterung des Bereichs der philosophischen Logik erfordert, so dass diese auch die Begriffe des korrekten Argumentierens in den drei genannten Kontexten enthalt.

AB  - Systems engineers have often paid too little attention to the nature of the so-called â€œusersâ€ of products under development. These are better called stakeholders, as many roles are involved, and few of those are in direct contact with the developed products. A simple and robust conceptual framework for classifying development stakeholders â€” a taxonomy â€” is proposed. The taxonomy is product centric, with concentric â€œcirclesâ€ denoting broad categories of stakeholders. Within these, generic â€œslotsâ€ describe typical classes of stakeholders; these are subdivided into â€œroles,â€ which are expected to vary at least in name with the domain. Examples are given, and a popular template is reanalysed using the framework. The taxonomy has immediate value in identifying and validating stakeholder roles in requirements elicitation, helping to ensure that key viewpoints are not missed, and hence reducing the risk of instability and failure during development.

AB  - ABSTRACT As governments seek to consult their citizens over matters of policy, it becomes increasingly important for citizens to receive relevant information in a medium that they can use, and will want to use, in forming their opinion upon consultative issues. In e-participation, there is a clear requirement to understand how technology can support informed debate on issues, but there are two main obstacles in achieving this. The first is that the deliberation is often on complex issues, and therefore typically there are many arguments and counter arguments to consider, which, when presented in linear text, can be confusing for the public at large. Second, it is not obvious that many people actually have the necessary critical thinking skills to deliberate on issues. Argumentation systems have been used successfully in the domains of law and education, where they have been developed in response to a need for innovative and effective ways of teaching critical thinking, presenting and defending a point of ...

AB  - In this paper I argue that to explain and resolve some kinds of disagreement we need to go beyond what logic alone can provide. In particular, following Perelman, I argue that we need to consider how arguments are ascribed different strengths by different audiences, according to how accepting these arguments promotes values favoured by the audience to which they are addressed. I show how we can extend the standard framework for modelling argumentation systems to allow different audiences to be represented. I also show how this formalism can explain how some disputes can be resolved while in others the parties can only agree to differ. I illustrate this by consideration of a legal example. Finally, I make some suggestions as to where these values come from, and how they can be used to explain differences across jurisdictions, and changes in views over time.

AB  - This paper studies the modelling of legal reasoning about evidence within general theories of defeasible reasoning and argumentation. In particular, it is studied how Wigmore's method for charting evidence and its use by modern legal evidence scholars can be exploited by modern visualisation software for argumentation, and how a formal account of the method can be given in terms of logics for defeasible argumentation. Two notions turn out to be crucial, viz. argumentation schemes and empirical generalisations.

AB  - Access to legal information and, in particular, to legal literature is examined for the creation of a search and retrieval system for Italian legal literature. The design and implementation of services such as integrated access to a wide range of resources are described, with a particular focus on the importance of exploiting metadata assigned to disparate legal material. The integration of structured repositories and Web documents is the main purpose of the system: it is constructed on the basis of a federation system with service provider functions, aiming at creating a centralized index of legal resources. The index is based on a uniform metadata view created for structured data by means of the OAI approach and for Web documents by a machine learning approach, which, in this paper, has been assessed as regards document classification. Semantic searching is a major requirement for legal literature users and a solution based on the exploitation of Dublin Core metadata, as well as the use of legal ontologies and related terms prepared for accessing indexed articles have been implemented.

AB  - A legal expert system expresses as a set of formal rules the norms found in the provisions of a statute or regulation, in case law or other legal texts. The process of constructing the system involves interpreting these legal texts and recasting each of them into one or more formal legal rules. The primary sources of law or law-formulations, to use Susskind’s term [Susskind 87, 36-37, 124], must be transformed into law-statements—statements about what the content of the law is—and these in turn must be translated into a formal language as rules of inference which Susskind terms legal productions. These transformations take place outside the context of specific cases, that is without reference to concrete legal problems those rules are designed to solve. The construction of a legal expert system involves two conceptual steps: to identify the legal norms that a statute conveys and to express these norms as formal rules. Several strategies have been proposed for this transformation process. Some consist of a rather straightforward transposition of law texts into formal language at the expense of a substantial loss of meaning of the legal concepts involved; others call for a subtler and more complex legal analysis. In all cases, however, what is at stake is the interpretation of legal documents. The problem of interpreting legal documents is well known to lawyers. In legal usage, the term interpretation is employed when the meaning of a legal text, typically a statutory provision, has to be assessed in a concrete situation. In constructing expert systems, one must interpret legal documents ahead of such concrete applications. This interpretation can only be provisional. The best one can do in constructing the knowledge base is to foreclose as few as possible of the meanings for particular provisions one may ultimately want to consider in concrete situations. Conversely, when using the system in a particular situation, one may want to consider different interpretations and their

AB  - Preparations for Y2K reminded the software engineering community of the extent to which long-lived software systems are embedded in our daily environments. As systems are maintained and enhanced throughout their lifecycles they appear to follow generalized behaviors described by the laws of software evolution. Within this context, however, there is some question of how and why systems may evolve differently. The objective of this work is to answer the question: do systems follow a set of identifiable evolutionary patterns? In this paper we use software volatility to describe the lifecycle evolution of a portfolio of 23 software systems. We show by example that a vector of software volatility levels can represent lifecycle behavior of a software system. We further demonstrate that the portfolio ' s 23 software volatility vectors can be grouped into four distinguishable patterns. Thus, we show by example that there are different patterns of system lifecycle behavior, i.e. software evolution.

This work is based on processing a set of legal questions with a system consisting of a semi-automatic Web blog search module and FastSum, a fully automatic extractive multi-document sentiment summarization system. We provide quantitative evaluation results of the summaries using legal expert reviewers. We report baseline evaluation results for query-based sentiment summarization for legal blogs: on a five-point scale, average responsiveness and linguistic quality are slightly higher than 2 (with human inter-rater agreement at k = 0.75). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evaluation of sentiment summarization in the legal blogosphere.

AB  - There has been an increasing interest in conducting Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR) among Requirements Engineering (RE) researchers in recent years. However, so far there have been no tertiary studies conducted to provide a comprehensive overview of these published SLR in RE. In this paper we present a tertiary study of SLR that focus solely on RE related topics by following the guidelines of Evidence Based Software Engineering. We have conducted both automated search of major online sources and manual search of the RE and SLR related conferences and journals. Our tertiary study has identified 53 distinct systematic reviews published from 2006 to 2014 and reported in 64 publications. We have assessed the resulting SLR for their quality, and coverage of specific RE related topics thus identifying some gaps. We have observed that the quality of SLR in RE has been decreasing over the recent years. There is a strong need to replicate some of these SLR to increase the reliability of their results for future RE research.

AB  - Abstract   User experience (UX), as a recently established research area, is still haunted by the challenges of defining the scope of UX in general and operationalising experiential qualities in particular. To explore the basic question whether UX constructs are measurable, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 10 UX researchers from academia and one UX practitioner from the industry where a set of questions in relation to UX measurement were explored (Study 1). The interviewees expressed scepticism as well as ambivalence towards UX measures and shared anecdotes related to such measures in different contexts. Interestingly, the results suggested that design-oriented UX professionals tended to be sceptical about UX measurement. To examine whether such an attitude prevailed in the HCI community, we conducted a survey –  UX Measurement Attitudes Survey  (UXMAS) – with essentially the same set of 13 questions used in the interviews (Study 2). Specifically, participants were asked to rate a set of five statements to assess their attitude towards UX measurement, to identify (non)measurable experiential qualities with justifications, and to discuss the topic from the theoretical, methodological and practical perspectives. The survey was implemented in a paper-based and an online format. Altogether, 367 responses were received; 170 of them were valid and analysed. The survey provided empirical evidence on this issue as a baseline for progress in UX measurement. Overall, the survey results indicated that the attitude towards UX measurement was more positive than that identified in the interviews, and there were nuanced views on details of UX measurement. Implications for enhancing the acceptance of UX measures and the interplay between UX evaluation and system development are drawn: UX modelling grounded in theories to link experiential qualities with outcomes; the development of UX measurement tools with good measurement properties, and education within the HCI community to disseminate validated models, and measurement tools as well as their successful applications. Mutual recognition of the value of objective measures and subjective accounts of user experience can enhance the maturity of this area.

AB  - The need of determining the degree of semantic similarity, relatedness or distance between two concepts within the same ontology or two different ontologies is becoming an increasingly important task in the field of Information Retrieval. Although a great attention has been paid to design semantic similarity/relatedness methods based on taxonomies, there has been little discussion about the design of semantic similarity/relatedness methods based on ontologies. In this paper we introduce a novel graph-based semantic relatedness approach to calculate semantic relatedness considering both hierarchical and non-hierarchical concepts in an ontology. In addition, our approach considers some important properties such as different relation types, concepts' depth and distance that play an essential role in measuring semantic relatedness. Three experimental studies are provided to first illustrate that our approach give a different results than other measures in the literature. Then, we compare our approach against existed methods using a benchmark dataset, and finally, evaluate our approach by using a real ontology and compare the predictions of our semantic relatedness approach against the human-subject judgment. The results in all the experiments show a considerable improvement against traditional taxonomy-based measures.

AB  - We propose a framework for a collaborative legal information retrieval system based on dynamic logic programming. In order to be collaborative our system keeps the context of the interaction and tries to infer the user intentions. Each event is represented by logic programming facts which are used to dynamically update the previous user model. User intentions are inferred from this new model and are the basis of the interaction between the system and the legal texts knowledge base. As legal texts knowledge base we are using the documents from the Portuguese Attorney General (Procuradoria Geral da Republica). In this paper we will show some examples of the obtained collaborative behaviour.

In the preliminary part of this paper, we introduce the major steps in the learning process, then we present some works interested in Arabic ontology learning. The rest of the paper serves to propose our approach for ontology learning from Tunisian Legal Texts designed for legal information retrieval. The search process that we suggest exploits the user's profile and uses a query reformulation mechanism based on the learned ontology. The purpose of the system is to satisfy a user's specific retrieval requirement by finding the best response to his request.

AB  - We describe a system that processes court opinions and retrieves related cases from a citator database, so that new cases can be linked to earlier ones that they impact. The design of the system combines information extraction, information retrieval and machine learning techniques in a novel way. The fully implemented program is capable of performing prior case retrieval at human levels of recall and acceptable levels of precision.

AB  - Context. Researchers proposing a new metric have the burden of proof to demonstrate to the research community that the metric is acceptable in its intended use. This burden of proof is provided through the multi-faceted, scientific, and objective process of software metrics validation. Over the last 40 years, however, researchers have debated what constitutes a “valid” metric.   Aim. The debate over what constitutes a valid metric centers on software metrics validation criteria. The objective of this article is to guide researchers in making sound contributions to the field of software engineering metrics by providing a practical summary of the metrics validation criteria found in the academic literature.   Method. We conducted a systematic literature review that began with 2,288 papers and ultimately focused on 20 papers. After extracting 47 unique validation criteria from these 20 papers, we performed a comparative analysis to explore the relationships amongst the criteria.   Results. Our 47 validation criteria represent a diverse view of what constitutes a valid metric. We present an analysis of the criteria's categorization, conflicts, common themes, and philosophical motivations behind the validation criteria.   Conclusions. Although the 47 validation criteria are not conflict-free, the diversity of motivations and philosophies behind the validation criteria indicates that metrics validation is complex. Researchers proposing new metrics should consider the applicability of the validation criteria in terms of our categorization and analysis. Rather than arbitrarily choosing validation criteria for each metric, researchers should choose criteria that can confirm that the metric is appropriate for its intended use. We conclude that metrics validation criteria provide answers to questions that researchers have about the merits and limitations of a metric.

AB  - As knowledge representation tools become more sophisticated, and computer systems increase in power and ubiquity, the prospects of building practical applications based on the representation of large amounts of legislation draw closer. In this paper we reflect on our experience with developing a knowledge representation language for legal rules and an inference engine for this language in the Estrella project, in order to reconsider the principles which should guide the representation of legislation. One common demand, based largely on software engineering considerations relating to maintenance, verification and validation, is that representations should be isomorphic to their sources. We explore this notion by representing a fragment of German Family Law using our tools. We show that there are several different ways of representing even this small and simple fragment of law in an isomorphic fashion. Moreover these differences matter, in terms of where the burden of proof is allocated, in terms of the explanations produced, and in terms of the operational procedures that are reflected.

AB  - Cyber security increasingly depends on advance notice of emerging threats as individuals, groups or nations attempt to exfiltrate information or disrupt systems and services. Advance notice relies on having access to the right information at the right time. This information includes trace digital evidence, distributed across public and private networks that are governed by various privacy policies, inter-agency agreements, federal and state laws and international treaties. To enable rapid and assured information sharing that protects privacy, the US government needs a means to balance privacy with the need to share. In this paper, we review US laws and policies governing government surveillance and describe key elements for a privacy management framework that seeks to enable government investigations while protecting privacy in a systematic way. The framework aligns existing Federal investigative guidelines for attributing a cyberattack with concerns for automated decision making that arise from the Fourth Amendment “reasonable expectation of privacy” and several fair information practice principles. We discuss technical challenges for those seeking to implement this framework.

AB  - Bayesian networks are a predominant approach to analyse the findings of forensic scientists. In part, this is due to the way the Bayesian approach fits the scientific method employed in forensic practice. The design of Bayesian networks that accurately and comprehensively represent the relationships between investigative hypotheses and evidence remains difficult and sometimes contentious, however. Recent research has shown that argumentation can inform the construction of Bayesian networks. But argumentation is a distinct approach to evidential reasoning with its on representation formalisms. This issue could be alleviated if it were easy to represent Bayesian networks as argumentation diagrams. This position paper presents an investigation into the similarities, differences and synergies between Bayesian networks and argumentation diagrams and shows a first version of an algorithm to extract argumentation diagrams from Bayesian networks.

The conceptual markup of documents is done automatically using LUIMA, a law-specific semantic extraction toolbox based on the UIMA framework. The system consists of modules for automatic sub-sentence level annotation, machine learning based sentence annotation, basic retrieval using Apache Lucene and a machine learning based reranking of retrieved documents. In a leave-one-out experiment on a limited corpus, the resulting rankings scored higher for most tested queries than baseline rankings created using a commercial full-text legal information system.

AB  - Schedule risk is an important category of risk in complex system product development. This paper presents a framework that facilitates understanding schedule risk from a systems perspective. Research findings from literature and a Delphi-type survey of experienced product development managers and system engineers at a major aerospace company are synthesized into a framework characterizing sources of schedule uncertainty. The framework includes not only key uncertainty drivers but also the hypothesized or theorized relationships between them. Since risk is more than just uncertainty, consequences of schedule overruns and of schedule uncertainty itself are also discussed. This research contributes a more comprehensive, systems view to the studies of product development and risk management and to the practice of both in industry. The paper also examines potential paths for future research. © 1999, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Syst Eng 3: 129–142, 1999

AB  - Argumentation schemes are forms of reasoning that are fallible but correctable within a self-correcting framework. Their use provides a basis for taking rational action or for reasonably accepting a conclusion as a tentative hypothesis, but they are not deductively valid. We argue that teleological reasoning can provide the basis for justifying the use of argument schemes both in monological and dialogical reasoning. We consider how such a teleological justification, besides being inspired by the aim of directing a bounded cognizer to true belief and correct choices, needs to take into account the attitudes of dialogue partners as well as normative models of dialogue and communicative activity types, in particular social and cultural settings.

Whilst much research work insists on the importance of both these features, legal expert systems are being built using shallow models and no more propositional logic, and are claimed to be successful in use. There is then a prima facie conflict between findings of research and commercial practice, which this paper explores, and attempts to explain.

AB  - Software evolution research is limited by the amount of information available to researchers: Current version control tools do not store all the information generated by developers. They do not record every intermediate version of the system issued, but only snapshots taken when a developer commits source code into the repository. Additionally, most software evolution analysis tools are not a part of the day-to-day programming activities, because analysis tools are resource intensive and not integrated in development environments. We propose to model development information as change operations that we retrieve directly from the programming environment the developers are using, while they are effecting changes to the system. This accurate and incremental information opens new ways for both developers and researchers to explore and evolve complex systems.

AB  - Goal-oriented requirements engineering (GORE) has been introduced as a means of modeling and understanding the motivations for system requirements. Using models to make goals explicit helps to avoid system failures due to implementing the wrong requirements or ignoring certain stakeholder needs. These models are unique when compared to other models used in system analysis in that their structure naturally lends itself to an analysis of goal satisfaction. Existing work claims that analysis using goal models can facilitate decision making over functional or design alternatives, using criteria in the model. Many different approaches to the analysis of goal-oriented requirements models have been proposed, including several procedures that analyze the satisfaction or denial of goals. These procedures make different choices in their interpretation of the goal model syntax, the methods to resolve conflicting or partial evidence, and in the way they represent satisfaction. This work uses three available tools implementing seven similar goal satisfaction analysis procedures to analyze three sample goal models. Results are reported and compared. The purpose of this comparison is to understand the ways in which procedural design choices affect analysis results, and how differences in analysis results could lead to different recommendations over alternatives in the model. Our comparison shows that different satisfaction analysis techniques for goal models can produce variable results, depending on the structure of the model. Comparison findings lead us to recommend the use of satisfaction analysis techniques for goal models as only heuristics for decision making. Our results emphasize investigation into the benefits of satisfaction analysis beyond decision making, namely improving model quality, increasing domain knowledge, and facilitating communication.

AB  - Summary form only given. The paper briefly refers to a number of the, by now well known, results of the author's studies of software evolution since they provide a basis and framework for the development of a theory of the phenomenon. The author then summarises his most recent results outlining a proof that every E-type program reflects an unbounded number of assumptions about the application implemented, supported or modelled by the program. He shows that the presence of such assumptions is inevitable and that some of these become invalid over time as a consequence of changes in the dynamic real world. Some of the finite set of known assumptions reflected in the program is also become invalid. Together the resultant ever extending invalidity causes the software to require continuing change or to become ever more unsatisfactory or even invalid. This phenomenon provides the underlying and unavoidable cause of the universal experience that E-type software must be continually evolved to remain satisfactory and suggests that its further study and the development of methods and tools to reduce its considerable impact, economic and social cost, must form an important part of future software engineering R & D.

Other factors, such as the scattered distribution of the regulations across many sources, different terminologies and cross referencing, further complicate the technical issues in developing a regulation information management system. This paper describes a comparative analysis approach and its potential application to assist locating relevant regulations from different sources.

AB  - Digital contents distributed over the internet are regulated by law and by technical management systems. The latter include a semantic component that describes licenses, i.e. rights of use which are granted to the user. These elements of Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems are called Rights Expression Languages (REL), they gather terms and relations needed to build licenses. Some are based on an ontology of online licenses, not necessarily related to applicable law and various legal systems, and cannot interoperate. As a consequence, there is a need for a more generic way to express licenses. Here, generic means that rightholders should only need to express the license they need once, and semi-automatic tools should then translate this license so it can be browsed by any specific system. Hence it implies the necessity to be able to model concept semantics in order to translate a license expressed in generic terms into more specific terms that are compliant with the specific standards used by distribution systems. This work comes as part of larger studies on legal ontologies, legal systems and RELs.

AB  - The use of electronic health record (EHR) systems by medical professionals enables the electronic exchange of patient data, yielding cost and quality of care benefits. The United States American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 provides up to $34 billion for meaningful use of certified EHR systems. But, will these certified EHR systems provide the infrastructure for secure patient data exchange? As a window into the ability of current and emerging certification criteria to expose security vulnerabilities, we performed exploratory security analysis on a proprietary and an open source EHR. We were able to exploit a range of common code-level and design-level vulnerabilities. These common vulnerabilities would have remained undetected by the 2011 security certification test scripts from the Certification Commission for Health Information Technology, the most widely used certification process for EHR systems. The consequences of these exploits included, but were not limited to: exposing all users' login information, the ability of any user to view or edit health records for any patient, and creating a denial of service for all users. Based upon our results, we suggest that an enhanced set of security test scripts be used as entry criteria to the EHR certification process. Before certification bodies spend the time to certify that an EHR application is functionally complete, they should have confidence that the software system meets a basic level of security competence.

The system employs partial parsing techniques in conjunction with a semantic grammar to identify the language associated with such rulings. The most novel aspect of the system lies in its anaphora resolution module that combines syntactic, semantic, and domain-specific inference rules with local discourse information to link such language to case references.

AB  - Citizens have a variety of ways to consult with their representatives about policy proposals, seeking justifications, objecting to all or part of it, or making a counter-proposal. For the first, the representative needs only to state a justification. For the second, the representative would want to understand the objections, which may involve asking some questions. For the third, the citizen would have to provide a well formulated proposal that can then be critiqued from the standpoint of the government's own policy proposal. At the end of such a consultation, users will have aired their proposals, understood the implications, and received feedback on how their proposals contrast to that of the government.

PY  - 1987
AB  - This report proposes that recent advances using low-level connectionist representations offer new possibilities to those interested in free text information retrieval (IR). The AIR system demonstrates that this representation suits the IR domain well, particularly the special problems attending the more sophisticated forms of conceptual retrieval required in legal applications. Also, the natural way in which connectionist representations allow  learning  means that AIR can avoid the high costs associated with manual indexing while providing comparable results. The paper begins by motivating the importance of legal information retrieval, from the perspectives of both the Law and artificial intelligence (AI). Our approach is then compared to traditional methods for IR, and to more recent work using higher-level  symbolic  representations from AL After a brief introduction to connectionist representations in general, the AIR system is presented. The paper closes with evidence that this system does, in fact, begin to support the use of those “open textured” concepts that make the Law both a very difficult and a very illuminating domain for AI research.

AB  - The major goal of workers in the field of expert systems in law can be summarized as follows: through the use of computer technology, to make scarcs, human legal knowledge and expertise more widely available and easily accessible. This paper is directly concerned with that goal. It is divided into two parts. The first discusses a three year interdisciplinary research project in expert systems in law that involved the Law Faculty and the Programming Research Group of the University of Oxford. Some of the jurisprudential aspects of the project are discussed and the prototype system that was developed is described. The second part of the paper addresses various considerations that are crucial for bringing expert systems in law out of the research laboratory and into the marketplace. And in this latter connection, the author's latest work - with Ernst & Whinney - is introduced.

AB  - The paper provides an OWL ontology for legal cases with an instantiation of the legal case Popov v. Hayashi. The ontology makes explicit the conceptual knowledge of the legal case domain, supports reasoning about the domain, and can be used to annotate the text of cases, which in turn can be used to populate the ontology. A populated ontology is a case base which can be used for information retrieval, information extraction, and case based reasoning. The ontology contains not only elements for indexing the case (e.g. the parties, jurisdiction, and date), but as well elements used to reason to a decision such as argument schemes and the components input to the schemes. We use the Protege ontology editor and knowledge acquisition system, current guidelines for ontology development, and tools for visual and linguistic presentation of the ontology.

AB  - As forensic science and forensic statistics become increasingly sophisticated, and judges and juries demand more timely delivery of more convincing scientific evidence, crime investigation is becoming progressively more challenging. In particular, this development requires more effective and efficient evidence collection strategies, which are likely to produce the most conclusive information with limited available resources. Evidence collection is a difficult task, however, because it necessitates consideration of: a wide range of plausible crime scenarios, the evidence that may be produced under these hypothetical scenarios, and the investigative techniques that can recover and interpret the plausible pieces of evidence. A knowledge based system (KBS) can help crime investigators by retrieving and reasoning with such knowledge, provided that the KBS is sufficiently versatile to infer and analyse a wide range of plausible scenarios. This paper presents such a KBS. It employs a novel compositional modelling technique that is integrated into a Bayesian model based diagnostic system. These theoretical developments are illustrated by a realistic example of serious crime investigation.

This framework encompasses a model and method for extracting, codifying and storing in a database, relational excerpts of design knowledge from scholarly publications. We also outline a method for analyzing such a knowledge base, which is intended to support information system designers to retrieve, contextualize and evaluate knowledge base contents in relation to their own unique projects. Such a system may help designers build on each others' ideas and support an emerging community of practice. The framework was evaluated by six information system design practitioners during semi-structured interviews. For this project, we codified design knowledge published in academic studies of online deliberation systems.

AB  - Motivated by the apportionment of diversity analysis due to C. R. Rao, a general approach to comparing populations of rankers is proposed. Each permutation metric corresponds to a particular population characteristic that forms the basis of the comparison. Tests of hypotheses concerning equality of characteristics are developed. Throughout, comparison is made with earlier work, most of which is based on the use of only the Spearman metric. Extension to tied rankings is discussed. Examples for two groups are presented which illustrate the computational feasibility as well as the value of the proposed procedures.

First, a deontic logic is described that allows for sensible reasoning in the presence of conflicting norms. Second, a simplified version of Ashley's account of precedent-based reasoning is reformulated within the framework of this deontic logic. Finally, some ideas from the theory of nonmonotonic inheritance are employed to show how Ashley's account might be elaborated to allow for a richer representation of the process of argumentation.

AB  - Lawyers and their large institutional clients increasingly face the enormous problem of how to efficiently and efficaciously conduct searches for relevant documents in large heterogeneous electronic data sets, for the purpose of responding to litigation demands. Past research indicates that lawyers greatly overestimate their true rate of recall in civil discovery. The unprecedented size, scale, and complexity of electronically stored data now potentially subject to routine capture in litigation, for purpose of preservation, access, and review, presents information retrieval researchers with a series of important challenges to overcome. This paper describes the current context of e-discovery and discusses the potential for IR and AI research to address the challenges of conducting e-discovery. The TREC Legal Track is presented as a forum for the evaluation of e-discovery research and one new evaluation measure, elusion, is described, which has potential for addressing problems of measuring recall.

AB  - This paper expands on the previously published value judgment formalism. The representation of situations is enhanced by introducing event progressions similar to actions in general AI planning. Using event progressions, situations can be assessed as to what facts they contain as well as what facts may ensue with some likelihood, thereby opening up a situation space. Purposive legal argumentation can be modeled using propositions and rules controlling the likelihoods of value-laden consequences. The paper expands the formalism to cover event progressions and illustrates the functionality using an example based on Young v. Hitchens.

AB  - There is a growing interest for the application of artificial intelligence in law. Research activities have investigated different areas : formulating legislation with the aid of logical models, legal reasoning, case-based reasoning, developing expert systems applied to the juridical or administrative domains. In project A.C.A.T. (Acquisition des connaissances et analyse de textes), we explore the possibility of creating knowledge bases by exploiting information contained in texts which are used in organizations. Our research focuses on a particular category of prescriptive texts : regulations from the Government of Quebec.  In order to verify these hypothesis we are developing a knowledge-acquisition system which will enable human specialists to transform a prescriptive text into the form of a knowledge base which can be exploited by an inference engine.  We introduce a model which enables us to identify three layers in prescriptive texts : the macrostructure, the microstructure and the dominial component. We describe the general architecture of the knowledge acquisition system which enables us to create “deontic” knowledge bases. We present the main knowledge structures used by the knowledge acquisition sub-system : the text grammars of macrostructure and microstructure.

In this paper we propose a new technique for the identification of single- and multi-word abstractions named Relevance driven abstraction identification (RAI) and a corresponding tool implementation, present an experiment comparing the effectiveness of our technique with human judgement and with a different technique proposed in the literature, and discuss a number of ways in which the abstractions so identified can be used to good profit in requirements engineering.

AB  - The distinction between action persuasion dialogues and deliberation dialogues is not always obvious at first sight. In this paper, we provide a characterisation of both types of dialogues that draws out the distinctive features of each. It is important to recognise the distinctions since participants in both types of dialogues will have different aims, which in turn affects whether a successful outcome can be reached. Such dialogues are typically conducted by exchanging arguments for and against certain options. The moves of the dialogue are designed to facilitate such exchanges. In particular, we show how the pre- and post-conditions for the use of particular moves in the dialogues are very different depending upon whether they are used as part of a persuasion over action or a deliberation dialogue. We draw out the distinctions with reference to a running example that we also present as a logic program in order to give a clear characterisation of the two types of dialogues, which is intended to enable t...

Hayashi. Several versions of both schemes are explained and discussed, and then applied to the argumentation given by Judge McCarthy as the basis of the reasoning used to arrive at his decision. The scheme for argument from fairness is shown to be based on a special principle in Perelman's theory of justice.

AB  - We address the problem of sentence alignment for monolingual corpora, a phenomenon distinct from alignment in parallel corpora. Aligning large comparable corpora automatically would provide a valuable resource for learning of text-to-text rewriting rules. We incorporate context into the search for an optimal alignment in two complementary ways: learning rules for matching paragraphs using topic structure and further refining the matching through local alignment to find good sentence pairs. Evaluation shows that our alignment method outperforms state-of-the-art systems developed for the same task.

AB  - The Resource Description Format (RDF) is used to represent information modeled as a "graph": a set of individual objects, along with a set of connections among those objects. In that role, RDF is one of the pillars of the so-called Semantic Web. This paper describes how RDF-XML is used to serialize information represented using graphs, how RDF graphs can be read and written by using the Jena software package, and how distributed graphs can be queried using the SparQL query language. It includes examples showing how SparQL can be used to query data (such as the Gene Ontology) that is structured in hierarchies, and how SparQL queries can be submitted through SparQL endpoints. It does not, however, delve into inference or the Web Ontology Language (OWL), but should provide a foundation for understanding those topics.

The major innovation is to allow the user modify the weights used to determine the importance of each feature in similarity measure. This innovation is called dynamic weights. Their objective is to improve the retrieval accuracy in systems that have a human expert supporting the case base creation. In this paper, we analyze the recall and usefulness of dynamic weights, suggesting a new calibration of attribute relevance to achieve the their total efficiency.

AB  - Mixture of experts (ME) is one of the most popular and interesting combining methods, which has great potential to improve performance in machine learning. ME is established based on the divide-and-conquer principle in which the problem space is divided between a few neural network experts, supervised by a gating network. In earlier works on ME, different strategies were developed to divide the problem space between the experts. To survey and analyse these methods more clearly, we present a categorisation of the ME literature based on this difference. Various ME implementations were classified into two groups, according to the partitioning strategies used and both how and when the gating network is involved in the partitioning and combining procedures. In the first group, The conventional ME and the extensions of this method stochastically partition the problem space into a number of subspaces using a special employed error function, and experts become specialised in each subspace. In the second group, the problem space is explicitly partitioned by the clustering method before the experts' training process starts, and each expert is then assigned to one of these sub-spaces. Based on the implicit problem space partitioning using a tacit competitive process between the experts, we call the first group the mixture of implicitly localised experts (MILE), and the second group is called mixture of explicitly localised experts (MELE), as it uses pre-specified clusters. The properties of both groups are investigated in comparison with each other. Investigation of MILE versus MELE, discussing the advantages and disadvantages of each group, showed that the two approaches have complementary features. Moreover, the features of the ME method are compared with other popular combining methods, including boosting and negative correlation learning methods. As the investigated methods have complementary strengths and limitations, previous researches that attempted to combine their features in integrated approaches are reviewed and, moreover, some suggestions are proposed for future research directions.

AB  - This paper applies recent work on scripts and stories developed as tools of evidential reasoning in artificial intelligence to model the use of argument from analogy as a rhetorical device of persuasion. The example studied is Gerry Spence's closing argument in the case of Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corporation, said to be the most persuasive closing argument ever used in an American trial. It is shown using this example how argument from analogy is based on a similarity premise where similarity between two cases is modeled using the device of a story scheme from the hybrid theory of legal evidential reasoning (Bex in Arguments, stories and criminal evidence: a formal hybrid theory. Springer, Dordrecht 2011). It is shown how the rhetorical strategy of Spence's argumentation in the closing argument interweaves argument from analogy with explanation through three levels.

Using concurrent stock returns of non-U.S.-traded foreign firms to estimate normal U.S. returns, I find that U.S. firms experienced a statistically significant negative cumulative abnormal return around key SOX events. I then examine the cross-sectional variation of U.S. firms' returns around these events. Regression results are consistent with the nonaudit services and governance provisions imposing net costs. Additional tests show that deferring the compliance of Section 404, which mandates an internal control test, resulted in significant cost savings for nonaccelerated filers.

AB  - The study of contemporary requirements engineering (RE) methodologies indicates that modelling of organisational goals constitutes a central activity of the RE process. In particular, goals provide the rationale and drivethe elaboration of the requirements that operationalise them. They also provide the criteria against which the completeness and correctness of the requirements specification is validated. In other words, requirements implement goals in the same way that programs implement design specifications. Despite the significance of goals in RE, research in the field is fragmented. No research has so far taken place in order to define the overall role that goals play in RE. This paper puts forward a unifying view of goal analysis in the context of RE. This allows the identification of similarities and differences between the different conceptions of goal used by different approaches and promotes the understanding of the overall role of goal analysis in RE. Based on this understanding the various approaches can be put together, thus leading to a stronger goal-driven RE framework that takes advantage of the contributions from the many streams of goal-oriented research.

AB  - This article studies optimal fines when an offender's wealth is private information that can be obtained by the enforcement authority only after a costly audit. I derive the optimal fine for the underlying offense, the optimal fine for misrepresenting one's wealth level, and the optimal audit probability. I demonstrate that the optimal fine for misrepresenting wealth equals the fine for the offense divided by the audit probability, and therefore generally exceeds the fine for the offense. The optimal audit probability is positive, increases as the cost of an audit declines, and equals unity if the cost is sufficiently low. If the optimal audit probability is less than unity, there are some individuals who are capable of paying the fine for the offense who misrepresent their wealth levels. I also show that the optimal fine for the offense results in underdeterrence due to the cost of auditing wealth levels.

AB  - This paper builds on the recent ASPIC^+ formalism, to develop a general framework for argumentation with preferences. We motivate a revised definition of conflict free sets of arguments, adapt ASPIC^+ to accommodate a broader range of instantiating logics, and show that under some assumptions, the resulting framework satisfies key properties and rationality postulates. We then show that the generalised framework accommodates Tarskian logic instantiations extended with preferences, and then study instantiations of the framework by classical logic approaches to argumentation. We conclude by arguing that ASPIC^+@?s modelling of defeasible inference rules further testifies to the generality of the framework, and then examine and counter recent critiques of Dung@?s framework and its extensions to accommodate preferences.

AB  - The contemporary world produces huge bodies of policies and regulations, while the underlying procedures tend to be automated in decision systems, which are designed to define, deploy, execute, monitor and maintain the various rules to which an organization or enterprise has to comply. It is important that the written documentation is integrated into such decision systems in order to refer to the texts to explain decisions, to update the systems when the policy evolves or, conversely, to amend the source documents if some of the rules happen to be inconsistent. The problem is that the complexity of information to be searched for is not reachable by an automated processing, but that their volume prohibits a manual one. Arguing that the integration of policies in decision systems can be better achieved through a semantic annotation than by the full parsing of the source documentation, this paper presents a technical environment that enables the building and exploitation of such semantic annotations.

AB  - In this paper we analyze the procedural considerations that affect the use of legal casesas precedents and propose a model of procedural knowledge that can be combined with substantive legal reasoning models to produce a more robust theory of case-based legal reasoning in common law jurisdictions. Our model addresses one component of procedural knowledge the distinction between questions of fact and questions of law. We categorize 32 different procedural scenarios into 10 basic types of legal results. We then propose rules for determining the precedential value of these result types. Finally we suggest a method for incorporating procedural distinctions into case-based reasoning systems.

AB  - Reliability Validation and Verification (V&V) has become a major issue in every industry nowadays. In the development of an embedded system, it is important to be able to determine if the system meets specifications and if its outputs are correct. This is the process of V&V. Airbus applied this V&V process in safety assessment on A380 from aircraft level to supplier level. Aircraft level safety process was implemented for the first time on a large-scale commercial aircraft. To ensure the achievement of goal reliability before entry into service, Airbus has put in more tests on A380 beyond the safety requirements from FAA. This paper presents the methodology of V&V process in A380 aircraft reliability program with the example case study of how Engine Alliance implemented this process in GP7200 design for safety and reliability.

AB  - We present the challenges facing businesses wishing to outsource processes to service providers who must maintain regulatory compliance via data access control procedures. We argue that it is not currently possible to capture the necessary agreements, and supporting evidence, pertaining to the usage of data a client may send to a service provider. As a result, the richness of evidence and controls a client has available to it reduces when they choose to use an outsourcer, therefore lessening the business value of considering service outsourcing. The paper introduces a model to clarify these issues, which is implemented against a health-care scenario, to show how data usage in an outsourcing scenario can be better captured and controlled.

AB  - Abstract The main claim of this paper is that reasoning with rules, especially rules of law, is different from reasoning with statements that are true or false. This difference is, amongst others, reflected in the defeasibility of arguments in which rules play a role. Reason‐based logic is a logic that has special facilities for dealing with rules and with reasons based on rules. In particular it allows arguments in which conclusions are derived by ‘weighing’ the reasons that plead for and against them. In this article we illustrate some characteristics of reasoning with rules, and show how reason‐based logic deals with these characteristics. The article is concluded with some general considerations concerning reason‐based logic and a comparison with some other logics for defeasible reasoning.

AB  - This paper explores the presence and forms of evaluation in articles published in the journal Artificial Intelligence and Law for the ten-year period from 2005 through 2014. It represents a meta-level study of some the most significant works produced by the AI and Law community, in this case nearly 140 research articles published in the AI and Law journal. It also compares its findings to previous work conducted on evaluation appearing in the Proceedings of the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law (ICAIL). In addition, the paper highlights works harnessing performance evaluation as one of their chief scientific tools and the means by which they use it. It extends the argument for why evaluation is essential in formal Artificial Intelligence and Law reports such as those in the journal. As in the case of two earlier works on the topic, it pursues answers to the questions: how good is the system, algorithm or proposal?, how reliable is the approach or technique?, and, ultimately, does the method work? The paper investigates the role of performance evaluation in scientific research reports, underscoring the argument that a performance-based 'ethic' signifies a level of maturity and scientific rigor within a community. In addition, the work examines recent publications that address the same critical issue within the broader field of Artificial Intelligence.

AB  - New-product development is commonly risky, judging by the number of high-profile failures that continue to occur-especially in software engineering. We can trace many of these failures back to requirements-related issues. Triage is a technique that the medical profession uses to prioritize treatment to patients on the basis of their symptoms' severity. Trauma triage provides some tantalizing insights into how we might measure risk of failure early, quickly, and accurately. For projects at significant risk, we could activate a "requirements trauma system" to include specialists, processes, and tools designed to correct the issues and improve the probability that the project ends successfully. We explain these techniques and suggest how we can adapt them to help identify and quantify requirements-related risks.

AB  - Legislative sources are currently accessible via portal web sites. Users demand precise and exhaustive answers to their information queries. When legislation is drafted, it contains text-rich information that is increasingly marked with XML tags. The statute structure as signaled by XML markup can be exploited to more precisely answer free information queries. In this paper we report on several XML retrieval models that we explicitly designed for the retrieval of legislation. We show that the models provide more advanced access to the content of statutes.

It does so in applying the argumentation framework of Prakken (1993a/b) to the legal domain. Three elements of the framework are particularly illustrated: firstly, its generality, in that it leaves room for any standard for comparing pairs of arguments; secondly, its ability to model the combined use of these standards; and finally, its relevance for modelling metalevel reasoning. These three features make the framework suitable as a logical framework for any theory of legal argument.

AB  - Analogy has been considered in AI and law primarily in relation to reasoning from precedent cases rather than reasoning from statutes. Where a statutory provision does not apply to a case, the principle of e contrario, that if the case is not covered by the rule the negation of the conclusion can be taken as established, has typically been assumed to apply. There are, however, cases where analogy is an appropriate way to bring a case under a statutory rule. In this paper we discuss using analogy in reasoning with states, and where this should be avoided and e contrario followed. Our account will be based on the notion of factors as developed in AI and law case based reasoning.

AB  - Though many tools are available to help programmers working on change tasks, and several studies have been conducted to understand how programmers comprehend systems, little is known about the specific kinds of questions programmers ask when evolving a code base. To fill this gap we conducted two qualitative studies of programmers performing change tasks to medium to large sized programs. One study involved newcomers working on assigned change tasks to a medium-sized code base. The other study involved industrial programmers working on their own change tasks on code with which they had experience. The focus of our analysis has been on what information a programmer needs to know about a code base while performing a change task and also on howthey go about discovering that information. Based on this analysis we catalog and categorize 44 different kinds of questions asked by our participants. We also describe important context for how those questions were answered by our participants, including their use of tools.

We study the distinction between weak and strong permissions in the context of input/output logic, combining the logic with constraints, priorities and hierarchies of normative authorities. In this setting we observe that the notion of prohibition immunity no longer applies, and we introduce a new notion of permission as exception and a new distinction between static and dynamic norms. We show that strong permissions can dynamically change a normative system by adding exceptions to obligations, provide an explicit representation of what is permitted to the subjects of the normative system and allow higher level authorities to limit the changes that lower level authorities can do to the normative system.

PY  - 1997
AB  - Requirements engineering is the branch of software engineering concerned with the real-world goals for, functions of, and constraints on software systems. It is also concerned with the relationship of these factors to precise specifications of software behavior, and to their evolution over time and across software families. Of all the areas in which computer scientists do research, requirements engineering is probably the most informal, interdisciplinary, and subjective. Although these qualities are inherent to the topic under investigation, they make scientists and mathematicians uncomfortable. Given these circumstances, a rigorous classification of research efforts in requirements engineering-if comprehensive and intelligible-might have several benefits, including: 1. It would delineate the area and would encourage research coverage of the whole area. 2. It would provide structure that might encourage the discovery and articulation of new principles. 3. It would assist in grouping similar things, such as competing solutions to the same problem. These groupings would be a great help in comparing, extending, and exploiting results. This article proposes and justifies a trial classification scheme. An earlier version was used to organize the papers submitted to this symposium, and the scheme has been refined somewhat in response to inadequacies discovered during the process of selecting the program. It is offered in hopes of stimulating discussion and eventual consensus. The fist issue to be tackled is the heterogeneity of the topics usually considered part of requirements engineering. They include Tasks that must be completed: elicitation, validation, specification. Problems that must be solved: barriers to communication, incompleteness, inconsistency. Solutions to problems: formal languages and analysis algorithms, prototyping, metrics, traceability. Ways of contributing to knowledge: descriptions of practice, case studies, controlled experiments. Types of system:: embedded systems, safety-critical systems, distributed systems. A list with all these topics is intended to be comprehensive, but its heterogeneity undermines all chance of bringing order to the field. There seems to be a need for several orthogonal dimensions of classification. While multiple dimensions will certainly help us cope with the heterogeneity of concerns, there is a danger of making the classification scheme too complex to use. I have compromised by settling on two dimensions, which are presented separately in the next two sections.

The author begins by presenting a new analysis of the concept of legitimate authority and then gives a detailed explanation of the legal positivist's approach to law. Within this framework the author examines several areas where legal analysis is often thought to be impregnated with moral values, namely the social functions of law, the ideals of the rule of law, and the role of the courts. The last part of the book is devoted to some key substantive problems. The author argues that there is no obligation to obey the law. He provides a new analysis of respect for law, emphasizing its moral importance. The author maintains there is no right to civil disobedience in a liberal state (though actos of civil disobedience may occasionally be justified even in such a state) and he argues for a right of conscientious objection in certain areas.

AB  - Organizations, be it public or private, have to ensure that their operations are complying with various governmental regulations, otherwise they may suffer from law suits and financial losses, or they may even not be allowed to operate (e.g., in case of repeated violations). Therefore, organizations need to have a clear understanding of all the relevant regulations and verify that their business processes are designed and performed in a desired way. However, regulations can be fairly complex in terms of the conditions, targets, and scopes they refer to. Moreover, when considering a set of regulations, the possibility of interrelationships between them brings added complexity to compliance checking. Thus, ensuring regulatory compliance is not only labor and time consuming but also complex. In this paper, we propose a consistency and compliance checker framework (CCCF) that considers sets of interrelated regulations and aims at providing automated supports for organizations to analyze and verify their regulatory compliance. More specifically, CCCF takes legal regulations and business processes as inputs and provides the results of whether the regulations are consistent, whether the business processes are compliant with the regulations, and which business operations need to be adjusted in case of non-compliance. To validate our approach, we use a case study of customs declaration in international trade .

AB  - This paper presents the development by the DataLex Project, a joint research project by the authors, of a software ‘shell’ specifically suited to the development of legal expert systems, and its use to develop a number of experimental applications programs used for teaching and demonstrations in several Australian universities. The paper considers a number of characteristics which make the development of legal expert systems different in character from the development of similar systems in engineering, medicine and the natural sciences. These differences, together with some practical constraints, has been responsible for the particular form which the software tools have taken.We argue there are a number of systems which have been built or are being built by people whose primary interest and training is in computer science and who fundamentally misunderstand the nature of law and legal reasoning, primarily widespread misconception that law is a simple system of rules and that legal inference consists of a simple deductive application of these rules. We challenge the view that there is need to construct "deep conceptual" models before effective legal expert systems may be built, concluding that it is an empirical problem which may only be resolved by building systems and evaluating their performance. The design criteria for the software and applications developed by the DataLex Project are then set out, and the shell and a number of resulting applications described. The shell includes both a decision network module (LES:DN) and a module for precedent analysis by nearest neighbour discriminant analysis (PAANDA). A full text retrieval system (AIRS) is intended to be integrated into the shell, and the reasons why this is necessary are explained. Note: This was the first published paper concerning the DataLex project, and the first paper presented at the 1st ICAIL Conference.

AB  - This paper proposes a knowledge elicitation method based on serious gaming for theory construction about the effects of the law on the behaviours of agents. These games provide input to simulations of business process and product design alternatives. For knowledge representation, we have combined agent role descriptions with a generic task framework. An important thesis of this paper is that, in the interest of quick and simple domain analysis, agent roles, not intelligent agents, should be the focal object of simulation of complex social organizations. At least if getting a grip on social complexity is the purpose of modeling.

AB  - It is commonly acknowledged that the management of quality requirements is an important and difficult part of the requirements engineering process, which plays a critical role in software product development. In order to identify current research about quality requirements, a systematic literature review was performed. This paper identifies available empirical studies of quality requirements. A database and manual search identified 1,560 studies, of which 18 were found to be empirical research studies of high quality, and relevant to the research questions. The review investigates what is currently known about the benefits and limitations of methods of quality requirements. In addition, the state of research is presented for five identified areas: elicitation, dependencies, quality requirements metrics, cost estimations, and prioritization.

AB  - We describe a methodology for the automatic classification of legal cases expressed in natural language, which relies on existing legal ontologies and a commonsense knowledge base. This methodology is founded on a process consisting of three phases: an enrichment of a given legal ontology by associating its terms with topics retrieved from the Wikipedia knowledge base; an extraction of relevant concepts from a given textual legal case; and a matching between the enriched ontological terms and the extracted concepts. Such a process has been successfully implemented in a corresponding tool that is part of a larger framework for self-litigation and legal support for the Italian law.

AB  - Knowledge-based systems have often been criticised for the limited theoretical base upon which they are constructed. This view asserts that systems are often developed in an ad hoc, individual way that leads to unmaintainable, unreliable and non-rigorous systems. The last decade, however, has seen an increased effort to produce methodologies to counter this view as well as continued research into validation and verification techniques. This paper presents a brief discussion of some of the important research in knowledge-based system life cycles and development methods. Methodologies are considered and are discussed in light of two sets of quality assurance criteria.

Today we confront a pivotal moment in the world of technology standards, one that also involves the global economy and ecology. The need to rebuild our financial infrastructure and implement ways to preserve and conserve the environment has given many in the technical community a moment of clarity with regard to the role standards must play in these times. There is a growing realization that while the technical standards world has functioned well enough for decades, the system is in danger of being broken, hijacked, and exploited by partisan legal and political maneuvering. Many of us now recognize an opportunity to restore trust and implement consistent and pervasive safeguards in the standards community.

AB  - SimIShop is a simulation tool for intelligent manufacturing systems.The tool uses an agent-supported architecture to simulate manufacturing systems.SimIShop is an easy to use tool.It supports: model creation, simulation, animation and evaluation. The manufacturing field is an area where the application of simulation is an essential tool for validating methods and architectures before applying them on the factory floor. Despite the fact that there are a great number of simulation tools, most of them do not take into account the specific requirements of the "new manufacturing era" such as distributed organization, interoperability, cooperation, scalability, fault tolerance and agility. On the other hand, Multiagent System technology has demonstrated its utility in manufacturing system modeling and implementation. Agenthood features such as proactivity, reactivity, and sociability may also be useful for associating them with the specific simulation needs of the new changing requirements for manufacturing systems. In this paper, an Agent-supported Simulation Environment for intelligent manufacturing systems is presented. The different roles that are played by the agents of the simulation environment are defined taking into account the specific dynamic features in manufacturing simulation and the requirements of the new manufacturing era. Moreover, the interaction and cooperation scenarios among these agents are specified to facilitate manufacturing simulation in an appropriate and flexible way. A detailed evaluation study, with regards to the new manufacturing era requirements, demonstrates the advantages of the proposed approach over current state-of-the-art proposals.

AB  - There is growing interest in applying Scrum practices in Global Software Development to leverage the advantages of both. However, the effective use of Scrum practices largely depends on close interactions between project stakeholders. The distribution of project stakeholders in GSD provides significant challenges related to project collaboration processes that may limit the use of Scrum. However, project managers increasingly seek to use the Scrum model in their distributed projects. While there is an emerging body of industrial experience, there are limited empirical studies that discuss Scrum tailoring in GSD. The paper reports a multi-case study that investigates the impact of key project contextual factors on the use of Scrum practices in GSD. This study is relevant to researchers and practitioners who are seeking ways to use Scrum in GSD and improve project effectiveness.

AB  - TraditiottaJ information retrieval systems do not satis& the lawyers’ demands because they provide only syntactic representation of legal data, The bottleneck for the creation of the more promising conceptual information retrieval systems is the time-consuming knowledge acquisition. The best solution is the representation of legal knowledge by simple linguistic tools, statistics and neural networks. In our prototype KONTERM we represent legal knowledge about concepts and documents by a knowledge base which is structured by statistical and connectionist methods. In fitture, this knowledge base will be used to filter legal knowledge from documents.

AB  - This articles provides a logical analysis of the concepts of directed obligation, prohibition and permission. These concepts are used to express normative relations between a bearer and a counterpart. They play a predominant role in Hohfeld’s analysis of rights. On our analysis, a directed obligation is defined as a conj unction of a statement expressing that a bearer ought to do a certain act and a statement expressing that it ought to be the case for the counterpart that the bearer does this act. A similar definition is offered of directed prohibition and permission. The proposed analysis is discussed in view of two competing theories of rights: the benefit theory and the claimant theory. The present proposal is found to be supported by the benefit theory. 1 The problem of how to represent directed obligations This paper contributes to the formal analysis of the concept of rights in the tradition from Hohfeld, Kanger and Lindahl. In a number of papers Allen and Saxon have defended the value of a formal representation of rights when making programs to aid the process of drafting or interpreting law (cf. [AS86], [AS93a], [AS93b]). (Concerning the relevance to automated tools for legal drafting, see also [H G93].) This supports the relevance of our paper to AI and Law. Furthermore, Jones and Sergot argues that certain complex systems are best analysed from a ‘normative perspective’, and suggests Lindahl’s analysis as a useful tool (cf. [JS93] ). In [Kro95] it is argued that a representation of normative relations discussed here may be useful to the design of multi–agent systems, as these systems have reached a level where full regimentation i= impossible and reliance will be based on the ability to make contracts between agents. This suggests the relevance of the present paper to mainstream AI as well.

AB  - We present a computational model of dialectical argumentation that could serve as a basis for legal reasoning. The legal domain is an instance of a domain in which knowledge is incomplete, uncertain, and inconsistent. Argumentation is well suited for reasoning in such weak theory domains. We model argument both as information structure, i.e., argument units connecting claims with supporting data, and as dialectical process, i.e., an alternating series of moves by opposing sides. Our model includes burden of proof as a key element, indicating what level of support must be achieved by one side to win the argument. Burden of proof acts as move filter, turntaking mechanism, and termination criterion, eventually determining the winner of an argument. Our model has been implemented in a computer program. We demonstrate the model by considering program output for two examples previously discussed in the artificial intelligence and legal reasoning literature.

AB  - The User Requirements Notation (URN), standardized by the International Telecommunication Union in 2008, is used to model and analyze requirements with goals and scenarios. This paper describes the first ten years of development of URN, and discusses ongoing efforts targeting the next ten years. We did a study inspired by the systematic literature review approach, querying five major search engines and using the existing URN Virtual Library. Based on the 281 scientific publications related to URN we collected and analyzed, we observe a shift from a more conventional use of URN for telecommunications and reactive systems to business process management and aspect-oriented modeling, with relevant extensions to the language being proposed. URN also benefits from a global and active research community, although industrial contributions are still sparse. URN is now a leading language for goal-driven and scenario-oriented modeling with a promising future for many application domains.

AB  - This paper presents an approach for the specification and implementation of translating contracts from a human-oriented form into an executable representation for monitoring. This will be done in the setting of RuleML. The task of monitoring contract execution and performance requires a logical account of deontic and defeasible aspects of legal language; currently such aspects are not covered by RuleML; accordingly we show how to extend it to cover such notions. From its logical form, the contract will thus be transformed into a machine readable rule notation and eventually implemented as executable semantics via any mark-up languages depending on the client's preference, for contract monitoring purposes.

AB  - This paper presents an experiment with a linguistic support tool for consolidation of requirements sets. The experiment is designed based on the requirements management process at a large market-driven software development company that develops generic solutions to satisfy many different customers. New requirements and requests for information are continuously issued, which must be analyzed and responded to. The new requirements should first be consolidated with the old to avoid reanalysis of previously elicited requirements and to complement existing requirements with new information. In the presented experiment, a new open-source tool is evaluated in a laboratory setting. The tool uses linguistic engineering techniques to calculate similarities between requirements and presents a ranked list of suggested similar requirements, between which links may be assigned. It is hypothesized that the proposed technique for finding and linking similar requirements makes the consolidation more efficient. The results show that subjects that are given the support provided by the tool are significantly more efficient and more correct in consolidating two requirements sets, than are subjects that do not get the support. The results suggest that the proposed techniques may give valuable support and save time in an industrial requirements consolidation process.

AB  - It is well-known that uncontrolled change to software can lead to increasing evolution costs caused by deteriorating structure and compromised system qualities. For complex systems, the need to carefully manage system evolution is critical. In this paper we outline an approach to managing evolution of object-oriented (OO) software. The approach is based on a goal-directed, cyclic process, in which OO models are transformed and quantitatively evaluated in each cycle. Evaluation criteria guide developers in choosing between alternative transformations in each cycle. The process, transformations, and evaluation techniques can be used to develop systems from a set of baseline models.

We argue that the approach we adopt is applicable to legal reasoning, where users, in general, cannot change facts and rules, but can propose their preferences about the relative strength of the rules.

We provide a comprehensive study of the possible combinatorial cases and we identify and analyse the cases where the revision process is successful.

AB  - An important part of our information-gathering behavior has always been to find out what other people think. With the growing availability and popularity of opinion-rich resources such as online review sites and personal blogs, new opportunities and challenges arise as people now can, and do, actively use information technologies to seek out and understand the opinions of others. The sudden eruption of activity in the area of opinion mining and sentiment analysis, which deals with the computational treatment of opinion, sentiment, and subjectivity in text, has thus occurred at least in part as a direct response to the surge of interest in new systems that deal directly with opinions as a first-class object.

This survey covers techniques and approaches that promise to directly enable opinion-oriented information-seeking systems. Our focus is on methods that seek to address the new challenges raised by sentiment-aware applications, as compared to those that are already present in more traditional fact-based analysis. We include material on summarization of evaluative text and on broader issues regarding privacy, manipulation, and economic impact that the development of opinion-oriented information-access services gives rise to. To facilitate future work, a discussion of available resources, benchmark datasets, and evaluation campaigns is also provided.

AB  - Regulatory compliance sets new requirements for business process management (BPM). Companies seek to enhance their corporate governance processes and are required to put in place measures for ensuring compliance to regulations. In this sense, this position paper (i) reviews the current work in the context of BPM systems and (ii) suggests future directions to improve the current status. During the literature review, techniques are classified as supporting forward or backward compliance. The latter is a post-execution compliance (i.e. based on execution histories of systems) and the former takes place at design- or run-time. In a nutshell, this position paper claims that four main aspects need to be incorporated by current compliance checking techniques: (i) an integrated approach able to cover the full BPM life-cycle, (ii) the support for compliance checks beyond control-flow-related aspects, (iii) intuitive graphical notations for business analysts, and (iv) embedding semantic technologies during the definition, deployment and executions of compliance checks.

AB  - This paper argues in favour of the necessity of dynamically restricting and expanding the applicability of norms regulating computer systems like multiagent systems, in situations where the compliance to the norm does not achieve the purpose of the norm. We propose a logical framework which distinguishes between constitutive and regulative norms and captures the norm change power and at the same time the limitations of the judicial system in dynamically revising the set of constitutive rules defining the concepts on which the applicability of norms is based. In particular, the framework is used to reconstruct some interpretive arguments described in legal theory such as those corresponding to the Roman maxims lex minus dixit quam voluit and lex magis dixit quam voluit. The logical framework is based on an extension of defeasible logic.

AB  - In this paper, we develop a theory of abstract argumentation systems. An abstract argumentation system is a collection of “defeasible proofs”, called arguments, that is partially ordered by a relation expressing the difference in conclusive force. The prefix “abstract” indicates that the theory is concerned neither with a specification of the underlying language, nor with the development of a subtheory that explains the partial order. An unstructured language, without logical connectives such as negation, makes arguments not (pairwise) inconsistent, but (groupwise) incompatible. Incompatibility and difference in conclusive force cause defeat among arguments. The aim of the theory is to find out which arguments eventually emerge undefeated. These arguments are considered to be in force. Several results are established. The main result is that arguments that are in force are precisely those that are in the limit of a so-called complete argumentation sequence.

AB  - Requirements traceability provides critical support throughout all phases of a software development project. However practice has repeatedly shown the difficulties involved in long term maintenance of traditional traceability matrices. Dynamic retrieval methods minimize the need for creating and maintaining explicit links and can significantly reduce the effort required to perform a manual trace. Unfortunately they suffer from recall and precision problems. This paper introduces three strategies for incorporating supporting information into a probabilistic retrieval algorithm in order to improve the performance of dynamic requirements traceability. The strategies include hierarchical modeling, logical clustering of artifacts, and semi-automated pruning of the probabilistic network. Experimental results indicate that enhancement strategies can be used effectively to improve trace retrieval results thereby increasing the practicality of utilizing dynamic trace retrieval methods.

AB  - We construct the complete network of 26,681 majority opinions written by the U.S. Supreme Court and the cases that cite them from 1791 to 2005. We describe a method for using the patterns in citations within and across cases to create importance scores that identify the most legally relevant precedents in the network of Supreme Court law at any given point in time. Our measures are superior to existing network-based alternatives and, for example, offer information regarding case importance not evident in simple citation counts. We also demonstrate the validity of our measures by showing that they are strongly correlated with the future citation behavior of state courts, the U.S. Courts of Appeals, and the U.S. Supreme Court. In so doing, we show that network analysis is a viable way of measuring how central a case is to law at the Court and suggest that it can be used to measure other legal concepts.

AB  - Requirements elicitation involves the construction of large sets of conceptual models. An important step in the analysis of these models is checking their consistency. Existing research largely focuses on checking consistency of individual models and of relationships between pairs of models. However, such strategy does not guarantee global consistency. In this paper, we propose a consistency checking approach that addresses this problem for homogeneous models. Given a set of models and a set of relationships between them, our approach works by first constructing a merged model and then verifying this model against the consistency constraints of interest. By keeping proper traceability information, consistency diagnostics obtained over the merge are projected back to the original models and their relationships. The paper also presents a set of reusable expressions for defining consistency constraints in conceptual modelling. We demonstrate the use of the developed expressions in the specification of consistency rules for class and ER diagrams, and i* goal models.

Based on the quality requirements for a telephony system, the authors individually used all six methods on separate occasions to prioritize the requirements. The methods were then characterized according to a number of criteria from a user's perspective. We found the analytic hierarchy process to be the most promising method, although it may be problematic to scale-up. In an industrial follow-up study we used the analytic hierarchy process to further investigate its applicability. We found that the process is demanding but worth the effort because of its ability to provide reliable results, promote knowledge transfer and create consensus among project members.

AB  - Companies publish privacy notices to notify consumers about their information practices. These privacy notices express company-specific commitments to the consumer about how the company will collect, use, and securely store data. Requirements engineers need to understand these commitments so they may be operationalized into specific security and privacy requirements. In the U.S., corporate commitments must meet the Federal Trade Commission's expectations for fair business practices. Companies must thus ensure that they maintain these commitments in accordance with corporate policies, laws, and regulations. We present an approach for identifying commitment-based requirements to support this objective.

AB  - Understanding the nature of privacy regulation is a challenge that requirements engineers face when building software systems in financial, healthcare, government, or other sensitive industries. Requirements engineers have begun to model privacy requirements based on taxonomic classifications of privacy. Independently, legal research has modeled privacy harms in a taxonomic fashion. In this paper, we compare a requirements engineering taxonomy of privacy protections and vulnerabilities to a legal taxonomy of privacy harms. We seek to determine the extent to which the concepts and terminology are consistent between the two taxonomies. A consistent, standard vocabulary for privacy concepts for both requirements engineers and lawyers will improve the common understanding of privacy concepts, legal traceability and compliance auditing. We conclude that the taxonomies we analyzed are reasonably compatible. We believe this compatibility indicates that a taxonomic understanding of privacy is a promising area of research for requirements engineers.

AB  - This paper presents an algorithm for automatically generating UML statecharts from a collection of UML sequence diagrams. Computer support for this transition between requirements and design is important for a successful application of UML's highly iterative, distributed software development process. There are three main issues which must be addressed when generating statecharts from sequence diagrams. Firstly, conflicts arising from the merging of independently developed sequence diagrams must be detected and resolved. Secondly, different sequence diagrams often contain identical or similar behaviors. For a true interleaving of the sequence diagrams, these behaviors must be recognized and merged. Finally, generated statecharts usually are only an approximation of the system and thus must be hand-modified and refined by designers. As such, the generated artifact should be highly structured and readable. In terms of statecharts, this corresponds to the introduction of hierarchy. Our algorithm successfully tackles all three of these aspects and will be illustrated in this paper with a well-known ATM example.

AB  - Requirements prioritization aims at identifying the most important requirements for a system (or a release). A large number of approaches have been proposed so far, to help decision makers in performing this activity. Some of them provide supporting tools. Questions on when a prioritization technique should be preferred to another one as well as on how to characterize and measure their properties arise. Several empirical studies have been conducted to analyze characteristics of the available approaches, but their results are often difficult to compare. In this paper we discuss an empirical study aiming at evaluating two state-of-the art, tool-supported requirements prioritization techniques, AHP and CBRanking. The experiment has been conducted with 18 experienced subjects on a set of 20 requirements from a real project. We focus on a crucial variable, namely the ranking accuracy. We discuss different ways to measure it and analyze the data collected in the experimental study with reference to this variable. Results indicate that AHP gives more accurate rankings than CBRanking, but the ranks produced by the two methods are similar for all the involved subjects.

AB  - A rule-based semantic approach for compliance checking.An ontological framework for regulatory compliance checking.Extracting regulations from semantic analysis of textual documents.Semantic rules to deliver regulatory compliance checking based on instances of the proposed ontology.Semantic mapping of regulations to data file formats. A key concern for professionals in any industry is ensuring regulatory compliance. Regulations are often complex and require in depth technical knowledge of the domain in which they operate. The level of technical detail and complexity in regulations is a barrier to their automation due to extensive software development time and costs that are involved. In this paper we present a rule-based semantic approach formulated as a methodology to overcome these issues by allowing domain experts to specify their own regulatory compliance systems without the need for extensive software development. Our methodology is based on the key idea that three semantic contexts are needed to fully understand the regulations being automated: the semantics of the target domain, the specific semantics of regulations being considered, and the semantics of the data format that is to be checked for compliance. This approach allows domain experts to create and maintain their own regulatory compliance systems, within a semantic domain that is familiar to them. At the same time, our approach allows for the often diverse nature of semantics within a particular domain by decoupling the specific semantics of regulations from the semantics of the domain itself. This paper demonstrates how our methodology has been validated using a series of regulations automated by professionals within the construction domain. The regulations that have been developed are then in turn validated on real building data stored in an industry specific format (the IFCs). The adoption of this methodology has greatly advanced the process of automating these complex sets of construction regulations, allowing the full automation of the regulation scheme within 18months. We believe that these positive results show that, by adopting our methodology, the barriers to the building of regulatory compliance systems will be greatly lowered and the adoption of three semantic domains proposed by our methodology provides tangible benefits.

AB  - Diagnosis theory reasons about incomplete knowledge and only considers the past. It distinguishes between violations and non-violations. Qualitative decision theory reasons about decision variables and considers the future. It distinguishes between fulfilled goals and unfulfilled goals. In this paper we formalize normative diagnoses and decisions in the special purpose formalism DIO(DE)2 as well as in extensions of the preference-based deontic logic PDL. The DIagnostic and DEcision-theoretic framework for DEontic reasoning DIO(DE)2 formalizes reasoning about violations and fulfillments, and is used to characterize the distinction between normative diagnosis theory and (qualitative) decision theory. The extension of the preference-based deontic logic PDL shows how normative diagnostic and decision-theoretic reasoning -- i.e. reasoning about violations and fulfillments -- can be formalized as an extension of deontic reasoning.

An experiment using a dataset which has also been used in previous experiments with other learning techniques is described, and comparison with previous experiments made. We also tested this method for its robustness to noise in learning data. Argumentation based machine learning is particularly suited to the legal domain as it makes use of the justifications of decisions which are available. Importantly, where a large number of decided cases are available, it provides a way of identifying which need to be considered. Using this technique, only decisions which will have an influence on the rules being learned are examined.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to determine under what circumstances individual organizations would be able to rely on cross-company-based estimation models. We performed a systematic review of studies that compared predictions from cross-company models with predictions from within-company models based on analysis of project data. Ten papers compared cross-company and within-company estimation models; however, only seven presented independent results. Of those seven, three found that cross-company models were not significantly different from within-company models, and four found that cross-company models were significantly worse than within-company models. Experimental procedures used by the studies differed making it impossible to undertake formal meta-analysis of the results. The main trend distinguishing study results was that studies with small within-company data sets (i.e., $20 projects) that used leave-one-out cross validation all found that the within-company model was significantly different (better) from the cross-company model. The results of this review are inconclusive. It is clear that some organizations would be ill-served by cross-company models whereas others would benefit. Further studies are needed, but they must be independent (i.e., based on different data bases or at least different single company data sets) and should address specific hypotheses concerning the conditions that would favor cross-company or within-company models. In addition, experimenters need to standardize their experimental procedures to enable formal meta-analysis, and recommendations are made in Section 3.

Nonetheless, there has been a lop-sided emphasis in the functionality of the software, even though the functionality is not useful or usable without the necessary non-functional characteristics. In this chapter, we review the state of the art on the treatment of non-functional requirements (hereafter, NFRs), while providing some prospects for future directions.

AB  - In this paper we argue that for realistic applications involving default reasoning it is necessary to reason about the priorities of defaults. Existing approaches require the knowledge engineer to explicitly state all relevant priorities which are then handled in an extra-logical manner, or they are restricted to priorities based on specificity, neglecting other relevant criteria. We present an approach where priority information can be represented within the logical language.

Our approach is based on PDL, a prioritized extension of Reiter's Default Logic recently proposed by the same author. In PDL the generation of extensions is controlled by an ordering of the defaults. This property is used here in the following way: we first build Reiter extensions of a given default theory. These extensions contain explicit information about the priorities of defaults. We then eliminate every extension E that cannot be reconstructed as a PDL extension based on a default ordering that is compatible with the priority information in E. An example from legal reasoning illustrates the power of our approach.

The Legal Taxonomy Syllabus is an ontology based tool designed to annotate and recover multi-lingua legal information and build conceptual dictionaries. The Legal Taxonomy Syllabus allows to build legal dictionaries in a bottom up fashion starting from the annotation of legal terms by legal terminological experts and to let legal ontology engineers refine the resulting taxonomies of concepts. The Legal Taxonomy Syllabus and its analytical tools provide help to lawyers to study the peculiarities of European Union Directives concerning the polysemy of legal terms, and the terminological and conceptual misalignment. By means of two case studies we show how the Legal Taxonomy Syllabus can help the processes of drafting and translating of the Directives.

AB  - This handbook is about writing software requirements specifications and legal contracts, two kinds of documents with similar needs for completeness, consistency, and precision. Particularly when these are written, as they usually are, in natural language, ambiguity—by any definition—is a major cause of their not specifying what they should. Simple misuse of the language in which the document is written is one source of these ambiguities. This handbook describes the ambiguity phenomenon from several points of view, including linguistics, software engineering, and the law. Several strategies for avoiding and detecting ambiguities are presented. Strong emphasis is given on the problems arising from the use of heavily used and seemingly unambiguous words and phrases such as “all”, “each”, and “every” in defining or referencing sets; positioning of “only”, “also”, and “even”; precedences of “and” and “or”; “a”, “all”, “any”, “each”, “one”, “some”, and “the” used as quantifiers; “or” and “and/or”; “that” vs. “which”; parallelism; pronouns referring to an idea; multiple adjectives; etc. Many examples from requirements documents and legal documents are examined. While no guide can overcome the careless or indifferent writer, this handbook is offered as a guide both for writing better requirements or contracts and for inspecting them for potential ambiguities.

AB  - Exactly predicting the future of an evolving large scale socio-technical system is impossible. Yet, if we are to sustainably manage the industrial and infrastructure systems our society depends on, we must understand how the actions we take today will affect the evolution of these systems. Simulating how the social and technical networks co-evolve over time allows us to explore possible system futures. This knowledge can help today’s decision makers to steer the system away from undesirable evolutionary pathways. Creating models that capture the complexity of socio-technical systems co-evolution requires multiple formalisms to be encoded in a modeling framework that itself evolves. This thesis presents a method for creating Agent Based Models that suitably represent complex evolving systems. The method involves a co-evolution between the technical aspects of model development, the social process involving the stakeholders, the collection of relevant domain knowledge and the encoding of facts. Through seven case studies the method is demonstrated to yield subsequent generations of richer and ever more useful simulation models.

AB  - Power indices such as the Banzhaf index were originally developed within voting theory in an attempt to rigorously characterise the influence that a voter is able to wield in a particular voting game. In this paper, we show how such power indices can be applied to understanding the relative importance of agents when we attempt to devise a coordination mechanism using the paradigm of social laws, or normative systems. Understanding how pivotal an agent is with respect to the success of a particular social law is of benefit when designing such social laws: we might typically aim to ensure that power is distributed evenly amongst the agents in a system, to avoid bottlenecks or single points of failure. After formally defining the framework and illustrating the role of power indices in it, we investigate the complexity of computing these indices, showing that the characteristic complexity result is #P-completeness. We then investigate cases where computing indices is computationally easy.

AB  - This paper reports a systematic review of empirical studies concerning the effectiveness of elicitation techniques, and the subsequent aggregation of empirical evidence gathered from those studies. The most significant results of the aggregation process are as follows: (1) Interviews, preferentially structured, appear to be one of the most effective elicitation techniques; (2) Many techniques often cited in the literature, like card sorting, ranking or thinking aloud, tend to be less effective than interviews; (3) Analyst experience does not appear to be a relevant factor; and (4) The studies conducted have not found the use of intermediate representations during elicitation to have significant positive effects. It should be noted that, as a general rule, the studies from which these results were aggregated have not been replicated, and therefore the above claims cannot be said to be absolutely certain. However, they can be used by researchers as pieces of knowledge to be further investigated and by practitioners in development projects, always taking into account that they are preliminary findings.

AB  - In the law, it is generally acknowledged that there are intuitive differences between reasoning with rules and reasoning with principles. For instance, a rule seems to lead directly to its conclusion if its condition is satisfied, while a principle seems to lead merely to a reason for its conclusion. However, the implications of these intuitive differences for the logical status of rules and principles remain controversial.

A radical opinion has been put forward by Dworkin (1978). The intuitive differences led him to argue for a strict logical distinction between rules and principles. Ever since, there has been a controversy whether the intuitive differences between rules and principles require a strict logical distinction between the two. For instance, Soeteman (1991) disagrees with Dworkin's opinion, and argues that rules and principles cannot be strictly distinguished, and do not have a different logical structure.

In this paper, we claim that the differences between rules and principles are merely a matter of degree. We give an integrated view on rules and principles in which rules and principles have the same logical structure, but different behavior in reasoning. In this view, both rules and principles are considered to consist of a condition and a conclusion. The observed differences between rules and principles are, in our view, the result of different types of relations that they have with other rules and principles. In the integrated view, typical rules and typical principles are the extremes of a spectrum.

We support our claim by giving an explicit formalization of our integrated view using the recently developed formal tools provided by Reason-Based Logic. As an application of our view on rules and principles, we give three ways of reconstructing reasoning by analogy.

This then allows for correct reasoning with causal and evidential rules, and further integrates arguments and stories by grounding them both in well-known dialectical argumentation semantics.

AB  - In modern software engineering, researchers regard a software system as an organic life form that must continue to evolve to remain successful. Unfortunately, little is known about how successful software systems have evolved, and consequently little has been learned from previous experience. We demonstrate a heuristic to reconstruct evolution processes of existing software systems by exploiting techniques to detect duplication in large amounts of data. A case study, evaluating various versions of Tomcat using this heuristic, revealed that the removal of duplicated code is a much smaller concern than grouping functionality in classes with one clear responsibility.

AB  - This paper presents a formal framework that addresses the twin problems of inconsistencies in requirements specifications and requirements evolution. It presents techniques (building on results from the areas of default reasoning and belief revision) for identifying maximal consistent subsets of a specification rendered inconsistent by a change step, with provision for retaining requirements that would be otherwise discarded, in anticipation of their future reuse. The paper identifies the need for consistent application of requirements rationale and provides support for this in the framework. While the problem of requirements evolution is intractable in the general case, tractable special cases exist within the framework. The paper also provides pointers to designing tools based on this framework.

AB  - We present a logical framework for modeling and reasoning about the evolution of requirements. We demonstrate how a sufficiently rich meta level logic can formally capture intuitive aspects of managing changes to requirements models, while maintaining completeness and consistency. We consider a theory as the deductive closure of a given set of axioms and conclude that software engineering is concerned, in essence, with, building and managing large theories. This theory construction commences with the development of the requirements model which we view as a theory of some nonmonotonic logic. Requirements evolution then involves the mapping of one such theory to another. Exploiting the deductive power of the theory of belief revision and nonmonotonic reasoning we develop a formal description of this mapping, as well as the requirements engineering process itself. This work thus offers a rigorous approach to reasoning about requirements evolution and a important focus for defining semantically well founded methods and tools for the effective management of changing requirements.

AB  - Evolutionary prototyping focuses on gathering a correct and consistent set of requirements. The process lends particular strength to building quality software by means of the ongoing clarification of existing requirements and the discovery of previously missing or unknown requirements. Traditionally, the iterative reexamination of a systems requirements has not been the panacea that practitioners sought, due to the predisposition for requirements creep and the difficulty in managing it. The paper proposes the combination of evolutionary prototyping and an aggressive risk mitigation strategy. Together, these techniques support successful requirements discovery and clarification, and they guard against the negative effects of requirements creep. We embody these techniques in a comprehensive software development model, which we call the EPRAM (Evolutionary Prototyping with Risk Analysis and Mitigation) model. The model was intentionally designed to comply with the Level 2 Key Process Area of the Software Engineering Institute's Capability Maturity Model. Validation is currently underway on several software development efforts that employ the model to support the rapid development of electronic commerce applications.

AB  - In this paper, we continue our research on a hybrid narrative-argumentative approach to evidential reasoning in the law by showing the interaction between factual reasoning (providing a proof for `what happened' in a case) and legal reasoning (making a decision based on the proof). First we extend the hybrid theory by making the connection with reasoning towards legal consequences. We then emphasise the role of legal stories (as opposed to the factual stories of the hybrid theory). Legal stories provide a coherent, holistic legal perspective on a case. They steer what needs to be proven but are also selected on the basis of what can be proven. We show how these legal stories can be used to model a shift of the legal perspective on a case, and we discuss how gaps in a legal story can be filled using a factual story (i.e. the process of reasoning with circumstantial evidence). Our model is illustrated by a discussion of the Dutch Wamel murder case.

AB  - Specifying correct and complete access control policies is essential to secure data and ensure privacy in information systems. Traditionally, policy specification has not been an explicit part of the software development process. This isolation of policy specification from software development often results in policies that are not in compliance with system requirements and/or organizational security and privacy policies, leaving the system vulnerable to data breaches. This paper presents the results and lessons learned from a case study that employs the Requirements-based Access Control Analysis and Policy Specification (ReCAPS) method to specify access control policies for a Web-based event registration system. The ReCAPS method aids software and security engineers in specifying access control policies derived from requirements specifications and other available sources. Our case study revealed that the ReCAPS method helps identify inconsistencies across various software artifacts, such as requirements specification, database design, and organizational security and privacy policies. Had these problems not been identified and resolved, they would have crippled later phases of software development, resulted in missing or incomplete system functionality, and compromised the system's security and privacy. This case study reinforces, validates, and extends our previous recommendations that access control policy specification should be an integral part of the software development process for information systems to achieve information assurance and improve the quality of the information system.

AB  - There is an urgent industrial need for new approaches to software evolution that will lead to far faster implementation of software changes. For the past 40 years, the techniques, processes and methods of software development have been dominated by supply side issues, and as a result the software industry is oriented towards developers rather than users. Existing software maintenance processes are simply too slow to meet the needs of many businesses. To achieve the levels of functionality, flexibility and time to market of changes and updates required by users, a radical shift is required in the development of software, with a more demand-centric view leading to software which will be delivered as a service, within the framework of an open marketplace. Although there are some signs that this approach is being adopted by industry, it is in a very limited and restricted form. We summarise research that has resulted in a long term strategic view of software engineering innovation. Based on this foundation, we describe more recent work that has resulted in an innovative demand-led model for the future of software. We describe a service architecture in which components may be bound instantly, just at the time they are needed and then the binding may be disengaged. Such ultra late binding requires that many non-functional attributes of the software are capable of automatic negotiation and resolution. Some of these attributes have been demonstrated and amplified through a prototype implementation based on existing and available technology.

AB  - With the increasing complexity of information systems, it is becoming increasingly unclear as to how information system behaviors relate to stated requirements. Although requirements documents and Business Activity Monitoring can provide static and dynamic evidence for requirements compliance, neither provides a formal, real-time presentation of requirements satisfaction. The REQMON research project is constructing and validating methods and tools for requirements specification and real-time monitoring. The challenge is to simplify monitoring system construction while ensuring the fidelity and expressiveness of its feedback. To address this challenge, our integrative approach leverages a formal monitoring abstraction layer, dynamically configurable distributed monitors, and commercial software to define a theory for specifying, developing, and analyzing requirements monitoring systems. This article presents an implementation of rule-based monitors, which are derived from system requirements. Such an implementation can simplify the specification of temporal requirements monitors and can be efficient, as our analysis shows.

AB  - It has long been accepted that requirements analysis should precede architectural design and implementation, but in software evolution and reverse engineering this concern with black-box analysis of function has necessarily been de-emphasized in favor of code-based analysis and designer-oriented interpretation. In this paper, we redress this balance by describing "functional paleontology," an approach to analyzing the evolution of user-visible features or services independent of architecture and design intent. We classify the benefits and burdens of interpersonal communication services into core and peripheral categories and investigate the telephony services available to domestic subscribers over a 50-year period. We report that services were introduced in discrete bursts, each of which emphasized different benefits and burdens. We discuss the general patterns of functional evolution that this "fossil record" illustrates and conclude by discussing their implications for forward engineering of software products.

This paper takes as a starting point the 'case comparison' interpretation of the stare decisis doctrine. In this interpretation one establishes by case c omparison which previously decided cases are sufficiently similar to a new case, after which the old conclusions are adopted in the new case. The paper shows how one ca n formally account for case comparison in terms of the dialectical arguments that cases give rise to. An innovation over previous work is that dialectical arguments are now formally defined, yielding a more transparent formal treatment of case comparison.

AB  - We reconsider two graphical aids to handling complex mixed masses of evidence in a legal case: Wigmore charts and Bayesian networks. Our aim is to forge a synthesis of their best features and to develop this further to overcome remaining limitations. One important consideration is the multilayered nature of a complex case, which can involve direct evidence, ancillary evidence, evidence about ancillary evidence, etc. all of a number of different kinds. If all these features are represented in one diagram, the result can be messy and hard to interpret. In addition, there are often recurrent features and patterns of evidence and evidential relations, e.g. credibility processes or match identification (DNA, eyewitness evidence, etc.), that may appear, in identical or similar form, at many different places within the same network, or within several different networks, and it is wasteful to model all these individually. The recently introduced technology of ‘object-oriented BNs’ suggests a way of dealing with these problems. Any network can itself contain instances of other networks, the details of which can be hidden from view until information on their detailed structure is desired. Moreover, generic networks to represent recurrent patterns of evidence can be constructed once and for all and copied or edited for reuse as needed. We describe the potential of this mode of description to simplify the construction and display of complex legal cases. To facilitate our narrative, the celebrated Sacco and Vanzetti murder case is used to illustrate the various methods discussed.

AB  - We analyse the computational complexity of the recently proposed ideal semantics within both abstract argumentation frameworks (afs) and assumption-based argumentation frameworks (abfs). It is shown that while typically less tractable than credulous admissibi-lity semantics, the natural decision problems arising with this extension-based model can, perhaps surprisingly, be decided more efficiently than sceptical preferred semantics. In particular the task of finding the unique ideal extension is easier than that of deciding if a given argument is accepted under the sceptical semantics. We provide efficient algorithmic approaches for the class of bipartite argumentation frameworks and, finally, present a number of technical results which offer strong indications that typical problems in ideal argumentation are complete for the class p"@?^C of languages decidable by polynomial time algorithms allowed to make non-adaptive queries to a C oracle, where C is an upper bound on the computational complexity of deciding credulous acceptance: C=np for afs and logic programming (lp) instantiations of abfs; [emailprotected]"2^p for abfs modelling default theories.

AB  - In this paper we describe an approach which can attempt to give a quanti- tative measure of the coherence of legal theories. Starting from the notion of a theory as described in (3), we show how some ideas of Thagard can be adapted to give a measure of how coherent such a theory is. Some experiments, using the wild animals domain and theories concerning it discussed in (3) are described. We then identify some issues, both of detail and principle, that are raised by this work.

AB  - The military-aerospace industries have several decades of experience in the application of systems engineering. In the world of complex systems developed under contract, systems engineering has a well-articulated, generally accepted, client-mandated methodology. This is not the case currently in most commercially oriented research and development organizations. Unlike the military-aerospace environment, it is not widely accepted that systems engineering can or will deliver value within commercial enterprises. This said, it is possible that a systems engineering-like methodology may be routinely employed but not so stated, or is recognized under a different label. This seems likely since complex products continue to be successfully developed and commercialized via the use of methods that are closely related to systems engineering. The purpose of this paper is to establish the groundwork for measuring the effectiveness of the systems engineering methodology, and closely associated analogs, as part of the product development process in a commercial research and development organization. In this paper, we review the literature in systems engineering and related fields to identify measurement issues and methodologies, specific metrics proposed and in use, and case studies and best practices. We also identify gaps in the literature and propose the next steps in a research agenda. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Syst Eng

AB  - We address a text regression problem: given a piece of text, predict a real-world continuous quantity associated with the text's meaning. In this work, the text is an SEC-mandated financial report published annually by a publicly-traded company, and the quantity to be predicted is volatility of stock returns, an empirical measure of financial risk. We apply well-known regression techniques to a large corpus of freely available financial reports, constructing regression models of volatility for the period following a report. Our models rival past volatility (a strong baseline) in predicting the target variable, and a single model that uses both can significantly outperform past volatility. Interestingly, our approach is more accurate for reports after the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, giving some evidence for the success of that legislation in making financial reports more informative.

AB  - Requirements specifications for high-assurance secure systems are rare in the open literature. This paper examines the development of a requirements document for a multilevel secure system that must meet stringent assurance and evaluation requirements. The system is designed to be secure, yet combines popular commercial components with specialised high-assurance ones. Functional and non-functional requirements pertinent to security are discussed. A multidimensional threat model is presented. The threat model accounts for the developmental and operational phases of system evolution and for each phase accounts for both physical and non-physical threats. We describe our team-based method for developing a requirements document and relate that process to techniques in requirements engineering. The system requirements document presented provides a calibration point for future security requirements engineering techniques intended to meet both functional and assurance goals.

We report our work on an EU airspace design project that describes a revised concept of operations for lower level airspace around airports, and includes simulation based safety analysis of the critical scenarios. We describe our research towards using i* to address two challenges – how to model the revised concept from the informal concept of operations document, and how to present safety critical scenarios to operational experts. Modelling strategic aspects of a concept of operations is new to ATM, and we draw upon our experiences to provide lessons learned and directions for future work.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to build the foundation for software architecture. We first develop an intuition for software architecture by appealing to several well-established architectural disciplines. On the basis of this intuition, we present a model of software architecture that consists of three components: elements, form, and rationale. Elements are either processing, data, or connecting elements. Form is defined in terms of the properties of, and the relationships among, the elements --- that is, the constraints on the elements. The rationale provides the underlying basis for the architecture in terms of the system constraints, which most often derive from the system requirements. We discuss the components of the model in the context of both architectures and architectural styles and present an extended example to illustrate some important architecture and style considerations. We conclude by presenting some of the benefits of our approach to software architecture, summarizing our contributions, and relating our approach to other current work.

AB  - There are many different approaches to elicit requirements, each having strengths and weaknesses. Hence, some approaches may be more suitable to one domain than another. Moreover, some domains may require these approaches to be carefully applied or even adapted to work efficiently. Health care domain is one of these domains. It is a complex domain with many subtleties, such as political and legal issues that have to be taken into account. This work brings some of the lessons learned in more than six years working with several hospitals and laboratories. Particularly, this paper presents some elicitation techniques that had to be adapted in order to comply with the constraints imposed by several peculiarities intrinsic to this domain. It also points out some special considerations that must be taken into account regardless the method one chooses to elicit requirements.

AB  - Most medical researchers, whether clinical or non-clinical, receive some background in statistics as undergraduates. However, it is most often brief, a long time ago, and largely forgotten by the time it is needed. Furthermore, many introductory texts fall short of adequately explaining the underlying concepts of statistics, and often are divorced from the reality of conducting and assessing medical research.

Practical Statistics for Medical Research is a problem-based text for medical researchers, medical students, and others in the medical arena who need to use statistics but have no specialized mathematics background. 

The author draws on twenty years of experience as a consulting medical statistician to provide clear explanations to key statistical concepts, with a firm emphasis on practical aspects of designing and analyzing medical research.

A contract that has manually been rewritten in a structured English is automatically translated into  a formal language using the Grammatical Framework (GF). In particular we use the contract language CL as a target formal language for this translation. In our framework CL specifications could then be input into the tool CLAN to detect the presence of conflicts (whether there are contradictory obligations, permissions, and prohibitions. We also use GF to get a version in (restricted) English of CL formulae. We discuss the implementation of such a framework.

AB  - This paper considers the need for evaluation of knowledge-based systems in general and legal knowledge-based systems in particular. Some special features of legal knowledge-based systems pertinent to their evaluation are presented. The expected benefits of such evaluations are discussed. and some of the difficulties likely to be encountered are outlined.  The proceedings of four International Conferences on Artificial Intelligence and Law are analysed to determine the rate of reporting evaluations in non-theoretical papers. These papers had a low rate of consideration of evaluation issues reflecting common practice in research biased development environments. These results confirm that more attention to evaluation is needed in the legal knowledge based systems domain.  This paper foreshadows the development of an evaluation methodology tailored specifically for legal knowledge-based systems. Evaluation strategies beyond verification and validation are drawn upon, both from the international ISO/IEC 14598 and 9126 standards and also from previous work on evaluation models for knowledge-based systems.

We also present a case study involving seven student projects, which represented an ideal workbench for the tool. The results emphasise the benefits provided by the tool in terms of new traceability links discovered, in addition to the links manually traced by the software engineer. Moreover, the tool was also helpful in identifying cases of lack of similarity between artefacts manually traced by the software engineer, thus revealing inconsistencies in the usage of domain terms in these artefacts. This information is valuable to assess the quality of the produced artefacts.

The articles forming this volume reflect a variety of important trends, developments, and applications covering a range of current topics relating to the theory and applications of argumentation. Our aims in this introduction are, firstly, to place these contributions in the context of the historical foundations of argumentation in AI and, subsequently, to discuss a number of themes that have emerged in recent years resulting in a significant broadening of the areas in which argumentation based methods are used. We begin by presenting a brief overview of the issues of interest within the classical study of argumentation: in particular, its relationship-in terms of both similarities and important differences-to traditional concepts of logical reasoning and mathematical proof. We continue by outlining how a number of foundational contributions provided the basis for the formulation of argumentation models and their promotion in AI related settings and then consider a number of new themes that have emerged in recent years, many of which provide the principal topics of the research presented in this volume.

The hybrid measure proposed here makes the most of TV metadata information and takes advantage of the two similarity measurements. It measures TV content similarity from the semantic level other than the physical level. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive strategy for setting the combination parameters. The experimental results showed that using the combining approach proposed here is superior to using either similarity measure alone for example-based retrieval of TV content.

AB  - Large-scale contractual systems engineering projects often need to comply with myriad government regulations and standards as part of contractual obligations. A key activity in the requirements engineering (RE) process for such a project is to demonstrate that all relevant requirements have been elicited from the regulatory documents and have been traced to the contract as well as to the target system components. That is, the requirements have met regulatory compliance. However, there are impediments to achieving this level of compliance due to such complexity factors as voluminous contract, large number of regulatory documents, and multiple domains of the system. Little empirical research has been conducted in the scientific community on identifying these impediments. Knowing these impediments is a driver for change in the solutions domain (i.e., creating improved or new methods, tools, processes, etc.) to deal with such impediments. Through a case study of an industrial RE project, we have identified a number of key impediments to achieving regulatory compliance in a large-scale, complex, systems engineering project. This project is an upgrade of a rail infrastructure system. The key contribution of the article is a number of hitherto uncovered impediments described in qualitative and quantitative terms. The article also describes an artefact model, depicting key artefacts and relationships involved in such a compliance project. This model was created from data gathered and observations made in this compliance project. In addition, the article describes emergent metrics on regulatory compliance of requirements that can possibly be used for estimating the effort needed to achieve regulatory compliance of system requirements.

AB  - Software evolution research has recently focused on new development paradigms, studying whether laws found in more classic development environments also apply. Previous works have pointed out that at least some laws seem not to be valid for these new environments and even Lehman has labeled those (up to the moment few) cases as anomalies and has suggested that further research is needed to clarify this issue. In this line, we consider in this paper a large set of libre (free, open source) software systems featuring a large community of users and developers. In particular, we analyze a number of projects found in literature up to now, including the Linux kernel. For comparison, we include other libre software kernels from the BSD family, and for completeness we consider a wider range of libre software applications. In the case of Linux and the other operating system kernels we have studied growth patterns also at the subsystem level. We have observed in the studied sample that super-linearity occurs only exceptionally, that many of the systems follow a linear growth pattern and that smooth growth is not that common. These results differ from the ones found generally in classical software evolution studies. Other behaviors and patterns give also a hint that development in the libre software world could follow different laws than those known, at least in some cases.

A probabilistic network model is used to generate traces between requirements, design elements, code and other artifacts stored in distributed 3rd party case tools such as DOORS, rational rose, and source code repositories. The tool is designed with extensibility in mind, so that additional artifact types and 3rd party case tools can be easily added. Trace results are displayed in both a textual and visual format. This paper briefly describes the underlying probabilistic model, and the user interface of the tool, and then discusses Poirot's deployment and use in an industrial setting.

PY  - 1985
AB  - For artificial intelligence, understanding the forms of human reasoning is a central goal. Legal reasoning is a form that makes a new set of demands on artificial intelligence methods. Most importantly, a computer program that reasons about legal problems must be able to distinguish between questions it is competent to answer and questions that human lawyers could seriously argue either way. In addition, a program for analyzing legal problems should be able to use both general legal rules and decisions in past cases; and it should be able to work with technical concepts that are only partly defined and subject to shifts of meaning. Each of these requirements has wider applications in artificial intelligence, beyond the legal domain.
This dissertation presents a computational framework for legal reasoning, within which such requirements can be accommodated. The development of the framework draws significantly on the philosophy of law, in which the elucidation of legal reasoning is an important topic. A key element of the framework is the legal distinction between hard cases and clear cases. In legal writing, this distinction has been taken for granted more often than it has been explored. Here, some initial heuristics are proposed by which a program might make the distinction.
The dissertation also describes an implemented program based on the framework. For definiteness, the program is given the task of analyzing law examination problems concerning the formation of contracts by offer and acceptance. The program performs adequately on a narrow class of such problems and appears to be extensible to other areas. Thus, the research opens up a line of investigation that may prove fruitful for both artifical intelligence and legal philosophy.

AB  - New regulatory regimes advocate the use of “goaloriented” regulations that are more flexible during regulatory conversations occurring between the regulators and the regulatees when new regulations are introduced. In that context, long-term “compliance agreements” between regulators and regulatees are needed. Using recent developments of the Measurement Theory, this paper shows that the concept of Measurement Framework (MF) for soft-systems is of particular importance for providing those compliance agreements. We show that with two kinds of goals and softgoals based on MF, one can improve (a) the elicitation of compliance requirements, (b) the structure of the compliance arguments for compliant requirements, and (c) the consistency between actual compliance at run-time and the intentional compliance at early stages of Requirements Engineering.

AB  - [Context and motivation] Compliance to relevant laws is increasingly recognized as a critical, but also expensive, quality for software requirements. [Question/Problem] Laws contain elements such as conditions and derogations that generate a space of possible compliance alternatives. During requirements engineering, an analyst has to select one of these compliance alternatives and ensure that the requirements specification she is putting together complies with that alternative. However, the space of such alternatives is often large. [Principal ideas and results] This paper extends Nomos 2, a modeling framework for laws, to support modeling of and reasoning with stakeholder preferences and priorities. The problem of preferred regulatory compliance is then defined as a problem of finding a compliance alternative that matches best stakeholder preferences. [Contribution] The paper defines the concept of preference between situations and integrates it with the Nomos 2 modeling language. It also presents a reasoning tool for preferences and illustrates its use with an extract from a use case concerning the Italian law on Electronic Health Record.

AB  - We present a novel technique that automatically alerts authors of requirements to the presence of potentially dangerous ambiguities. We first establish the notion of nocuous ambiguities, which are those that are likely to lead to misunderstandings. We test our approach on coordination ambiguities, which occur when words such as and and or are used. Our starting point is a dataset of ambiguous phrases from a requirements corpus and associated human judgements about their interpretation. We then use heuristics, based largely on word distribution information, to automatically replicate these judgements. The heuristics eliminate ambiguities which people interpret easily, leaving the nocuous ones to be analysed and rewritten by hand. We report on a series of experiments that evaluate our heuristics' performance against the human judgements. Many of our heuristics achieve high precision, and recall is greatly increased when they are used in combination.

AB  - In the last decades the interst in the problem of comparing and harmonizing legislation has been steadily increasing. One reason is the increasing legal convergence between governments in the European Union, and the increasing traffic of people over borders of jurisdictions. Another reason is the increasing globalization of companies; Products and services are offered in many jurisdictions at the same time, and the product or service has to meet the provisions of all jurisdictions in which it is offered. In the E-POWER project relevant tax legislation and business processes are modeled in UML to improve the speed and efficiency with which the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration can implement decision support systems for internal use and for its clients. These conceptual models have also proven their usefulness for efficient and effective analysis of draft legislation. We are currently researching whether conceptual modeling can also be used to compare 'similar' legislation from different jurisdictions to improve the capacity of the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration to react to future consequences of increased movement of people, products, and money between EU member states and increased harmonization between tax authorities in Europe. In addition, addressing the problem of comparing models is also expected to improve our methodology for modeling legislation. This paper discusses problems and requirements of comparing legislation as we understand them now, and attempts to relate them to relevant research.

AB  - The complexity of regulations in healthcare, financial services, and other industries makes it difficult for enterprises to design and deploy effective compliance systems. We believe that in some applications, it may be practical to support compliance by using formalized portions of applicable laws to regulate business processes that use information systems. In order to explore this possibility, we use a stratified fragment of Prolog with limited use of negation to formalize a portion of the US Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). As part of our study, we also explore the deployment of our formalization in a prototype hospital Web portal messaging system.

AB  - The current research explored whether two re- lated yet distinct social competencies—perspective taking (the cognitive capacity to consider the world from another individual's viewpoint) and empathy (the ability to connect emotionally with another individual)—have differential effects in negotiations. Across three studies, using both individual difference measures and experimental manip- ulations, we found that perspective taking increased in- dividuals' ability to discover hidden agreements and to both create and claim resources at the bargaining table. However, empathy did not prove nearly as advantageous and at times was detrimental to discovering a possible deal and achieving individual profit. These results held re- gardless of whether the interaction was a negotiation in which a prima facie solution was not possible or a multiple- issue negotiation that required discovering mutually ben- eficial trade-offs. Although empathy is an essential tool in many aspects of social life, perspective taking appears to be a particularly critical ability in negotiations.

AB  - In legal theory, a well-known idea is that an intermediate concept like “ownership” joins a set of legal consequences to a set of legal grounds. In our paper, we attempt to make the idea of a joining between grounds and consequences more precise by using an algebraic representation of normative systems earlier developed by the authors. In the first main part, the idea of intermediate concepts is presented and earlier discussions of the subjects are outlined. Subsequently, in the second main part, we introduce a more rigorous framework and develop the formal theory. In the third part, the formal framework is applied to examples and some remarks on a methodology of intermediate concepts are given.

AB  - Security requirements engineering is emerging as a branch of software engineering, spurred by the realization that security must be dealt with early on during the requirements phase. Methodologies in this field are challenging, as they must take into account subtle notions such as trust (or lack thereof), delegation, and permission; they must also model entire organizations and not only systems-to-be. In our previous work we introduced Secure Tropos, a formal framework for modeling and analyzing security requirements. Secure Tropos is founded on three main notions: ownership, trust, and delegation. In this paper, we refine Secure Tropos introducing the notions of at-least delegation and trust of execution; also, at-most delegation and trust of permission. We also propose monitoring as a security design pattern intended to overcome the problem of lack of trust between actors. The paper presents a semantic for these notions, and describes an implemented formal reasoning tool based on Datalog.

AB  - Case-based driven approaches to requirements prioritization proved to be much more effective than first-principle methods in being tailored to a specific problem, that is they take advantage of the implicit knowledge that is available, given a problem representation. In these approaches, first-principle prioritization criteria are replaced by a pairwise preference elicitation process. Nevertheless case-based approaches, using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) technique, become impractical when the size of the collection of requirements is greater than about twenty since the elicitation effort grows as the square of the number of requirements. We adopt a case-based framework for requirements prioritization, called case-based ranking, which exploits machine learning techniques to overcome the scalability problem. This method reduces the acquisition effort by combining human preference elicitation and automatic preference approximation. Our goal in this paper is to describe the framework in details and to present empirical evaluations which aim at showing its effectiveness in overcoming the scalability problem. The results prove that on average our approach outperforms AHP with respect to the trade-off between expert elicitation effort and the requirement prioritization accuracy.

AB  - Elicitation of requirements for safety critical aero-engine control systems is dependent on the capture of core design intent and the systematic derivation of requirements addressing hazardous deviations from that intent. Derivation of these requirements is inextricably linked to the safety assessment process. Conventional civil aerospace practice (as advocated by guidelines such as ARP4754 and ARP4671) promotes the application of Functional Hazard Assessment (FHA) to sets of statements of functional intent. Systematic hazard analysis of scenario-based requirements representations is less well understood. This paper discusses the principles and problems of hazard analysis and proposes an approach to conducting hazard analysis on use case requirements representations. Using the approach, it is possible to justifiably derive hazard-mitigation use cases as first class requirements from systematic hazard analysis of core design intent scenarios. An industrial example is used to illustrate the technique.

AB  - In the business world, analyzing and dealing with risk permeates all decisions and actions. However, to date, risk identification, the first step in the risk management cycle, has always been a manual activity with little to no intelligent software tool support. In addition, although companies are required to list risks to their business in their annual SEC filings in the USA, these descriptions are often very high-level and vague.

In this paper, we introduce Risk Mining, which is the task of identifying a set of risks pertaining to a business area or entity. We argue that by combining Web mining and Information Extraction (IE) techniques, risks can be detected automatically before they materialize, thus providing valuable business intelligence.

We describe a system that induces a risk taxonomy with concrete risks (e.g., interest rate changes) at its leaves and more abstract risks (e.g., financial risks) closer to its root node. The taxonomy is induced via a bootstrapping algorithms starting with a few seeds. The risk taxonomy is used by the system as input to a risk monitor that matches risk mentions in financial documents to the abstract risk types, thus bridging a lexical gap. Our system is able to automatically generate company specific "risk maps", which we demonstrate for a corpus of earnings report conference calls.

These are the obligations that take place when other obligations are violated as typically applied to penalties in contracts. The paper shows how this formalism can be mapped onto the key policy concepts of a contract specification language, called Business Contract Language (BCL), previously developed to express contract conditions for run time contract monitoring. The aim of this mapping is to establish a formal underpinning for this key subset of BCL.

AB  - Internet privacy policies describe an organization's practices on data collection, use, and disclosure. These privacy policies both protect the organization and signal integrity commitment to site visitors. Consumers use the stated website policies to guide browsing and transaction decisions. This paper compares the classes of privacy protection goals (which express desired protection of consumer privacy rights) and vulnerabilities (which potentially threaten consumer privacy) with consumer privacy values. For this study, we looked at privacy policies from nearly 50 websites and surveyed over 1000 Internet users. We examined Internet users' major expectations about website privacy and revealed a notable discrepancy between what privacy policies are currently stating and what users deem most significant. Our findings suggest several implications to privacy managers and software project managers. Results from this study can help managers determine the kinds of policies needed to both satisfy user values and ensure privacy-aware website development efforts.

AB  - The acquisition of requirements assets are important in software product line (SPL) engineering for it help enhancing the effectiveness of reuse. Traditional methods are heavily based on manual effort. This appears to be a barrier for many organizations which tend to launch a SPL. In this paper, we propose an approach to extract functional requirements by analyzing text-based software requirements specifications (SRSs). We analyze the linguistic characterization of SRSs. According to it we define extended functional requirements framework (EFRF) which consists of 10 semantic cases, then we generate converting rules. We introduce an NLP (Natural Language Process) approach to build EFRFs from documents based on the concept of EFRF and the converting rules. The extracted EFRFs are suitable for expression and modeling of functional requirements variability. We apply our method to an auto-marker software product line. The result shows the approach has high accuracy and efficiency, and the approach is readily scalable and extensible.

We take an engineering perspective on the development of such ontologies. Formal ontologies are viewed as designed artifacts, formulated for specific purposes and evaluated against objective design criteria. We describe the role of ontologies in supporting knowledge sharing activities, and then present a set of criteria to guide the development of ontologies for these purposes. We show how these criteria are applied in case studies from the design of ontologies for engineering mathematics and bibliographic data. Selected design decisions are discussed, and alternative representation choices and evaluated against the design criteria.

AB  - Argumentation is an important skill to learn. It is valuable not only in many professional contexts, such as the law, science, politics, and business, but also in everyday life. However, not many people are good arguers. In response to this, researchers and practitioners over the past 15–20 years have developed software tools both to support and teach argumentation. Some of these tools are used in individual fashion, to present students with the “rules” of argumentation in a particular domain and give them an opportunity to practice, while other tools are used in collaborative fashion, to facilitate communication and argumentation between multiple, and perhaps distant, participants. In this paper, we review the extensive literature on argumentation systems, both individual and collaborative, and both supportive and educational, with an eye toward particular aspects of the past work. More specifically, we review the types of argument representations that have been used, the various types of interaction design and ontologies that have been employed, and the system architecture issues that have been addressed. In addition, we discuss intelligent and automated features that have been imbued in past systems, such as automatically analyzing the quality of arguments and providing intelligent feedback to support and/or tutor argumentation. We also discuss a variety of empirical studies that have been done with argumentation systems, including, among other aspects, studies that have evaluated the effect of argument diagrams (e.g., textual versus graphical), different representations, and adaptive feedback on learning argumentation. Finally, we conclude by summarizing the “lessons learned” from this large and impressive body of work, particularly focusing on lessons for the CSCL research community and its ongoing efforts to develop computer-mediated collaborative argumentation systems.

AB  - Software developers are often faced with modification tasks that involve source which is spread across a code base. Some dependencies between source code, such as those between source code written in different languages, are difficult to determine using existing static and dynamic analyses. To augment existing analyses and to help developers identify relevant source code during a modification task, we have developed an approach that applies data mining techniques to determine change patterns - sets of files that were changed together frequently in the past - from the change history of the code base. Our hypothesis is that the change patterns can be used to recommend potentially relevant source code to a developer performing a modification task. We show that this approach can reveal valuable dependencies by applying the approach to the Eclipse and Mozilla open source projects and by evaluating the predictability and interestingness of the recommendations produced for actual modification tasks on these systems.

AB  - The increasing globalisation of the software industry demands an investigation of requirements engineering (RE) in multi-site software development organisations. Requirements engineering is a task difficult enough when done locally--but it is even more difficult when cross-functional stakeholder groups specify requirements across cultural, language and time zone boundaries. This paper reports on a field study that investigated RE challenges introduced by the stakeholders' geographical distribution in a multi-site organisation. The goal was to examine RE practices in global software development, and to formulate recommendations for improvement as well as to provide directions for future research on methods and tools. Based on the empirical evidence, we have constructed a model of how remote communication and knowledge management, cultural diversity and time differences negatively impact requirements gathering, negotiations and specifications. Findings reveal that aspects such as a lack of a common understanding of requirements, together with a reduced awareness of a working local context, a trust level and an ability to share work artefacts significantly challenge the effective collaboration of remote stakeholders in negotiating a set of requirements that satisfies geographically distributed customers. The paper concludes with recommendations for improving RE practices in this setting.

In this paper, we present both lawyer's perspective and software engineer's perspective on this problem and then we attempt to capture a common information space. The lawyer's perspective delivers a method for identifying and analyzing relevant laws and legal regulations. The software engineer's perspective discovers the specifics of dealing with law-related requirements with the use of requirements engineering as a frame of reference. The common information space includes a process of transforming legal regulations to legal requirements and a description of knowledge which must be shared in order to facilitate efficient collaboration.

AB  - Two paradigms characterize much of the research in the Information Systems discipline: behavioral science and design science. The behavioral-science paradigm seeks to develop and verify theories that explain or predict human or organizational behavior. The design-science paradigm seeks to extend the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating new and innovative artifacts. Both paradigms are foundational to the IS discipline, positioned as it is at the confluence of people, organizations, and technology. Our objective is to describe the performance of design-science research in Information Systems via a concise conceptual framework and clear guidelines for understanding, executing, and evaluating the research. In the design-science paradigm, knowledge and understanding of a problem domain and its solution are achieved in the building and application of the designed artifact. Three recent exemplars in the research literature are used to demonstrate the application of these guidelines. We conclude with an analysis of the challenges of performing high-quality design-science research in the context of the broader IS community.

AB  - We introduce the problem of risk analysis for Intellectual Property (IP) lawsuits. More specifically, we focus on estimating the risk for participating parties using solely prior factors, i. e., historical and concurrent behavior of the entities involved in the case. This work represents a first step towards building a comprehensive legal risk assessment system for parties involved in litigation. This technology will allow parties to optimize their case parameters to minimize their own risk, or to settle disputes out of court and thereby ease the burden on the judicial system. In addition, it will also help U.S. courts detect and fix any inherent biases in the system.   We model risk estimation as a relational classification problem using conditional random fields [6] to jointly estimate the risks of concurrent cases. We evaluate our model on data collected by the Stanford Intellectual Property Litigation Clearinghouse, which consists of over 4,200 IP lawsuits filed across 88 U.S. federal districts and ranging over 8 years, probably the largest legal data set reported in data mining research. Despite being agnostic to the merits of the case, our best model achieves a classification accuracy of 64%, 22% (relative) higher than the majority-class baseline.

AB  - Budgetary restrictions and time-to-market deadlines often require stakeholders to prioritize requirements and decide which ones to include in a given product release. Lack of an effective prioritization and triage process can lead to problems such as missed deadlines, disorganized development efforts, and late discovery of architecturally significant requirements. Existing prioritization techniques do not provide sufficient automation for large projects with hundreds of stakeholders and thousands of potentially conflicting requests and requirements. This paper therefore proposes an approach for automating a significant part of the prioritization process. The proposed method utilizes a probabilistic traceability model combined with a standard hierarchical clustering algorithm to cluster incoming stakeholder requests into hierarchical feature sets. Additional cross-cutting clusters are then generated to represent factors such as architecturally significant requirements or impacted business goals. Prioritization decisions are initially made at the feature level and then more critical requirements are promoted according to their relationships with the identified cross-cutting concerns. The approach is illustrated and evaluated through a case study applied to the requirements of the ice breaker system.

AB  - The main drawback of existing software artifact management systems is the lack of automatic or semi-automatic traceability link generation and maintenance. We have improved an artifact management system with a traceability recovery tool based on Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), an information retrieval technique. We have assessed LSI to identify strengths and limitations of using information retrieval techniques for traceability recovery and devised the need for an incremental approach. The method and the tool have been evaluated during the development of seventeen software projects involving about 150 students. We observed that although tools based on information retrieval provide a useful support for the identification of traceability links during software development, they are still far to support a complete semi-automatic recovery of all links. The results of our experience have also shown that such tools can help to identify quality problems in the textual description of traced artifacts.

AB  - The authors review propagation patterns for describing object-oriented software at a higher level of abstraction than one used by today's programming languages. A propagation pattern defines a family of programs from which one can select a member by giving a class dictionary graph that details the structure of behavior through part-of and inheritance relationships between classes. Three concepts are introduced: evolution histories, growth-plans and a propagation-directive calculus. Evolution histories describe a sequence of development phases of an object-oriented program, each phase being executable and therefore testable. To keep the programs flexible and short, they are described in terms of propagation patterns. Each phase of an evolution history is tested in small steps that are constrained by class dictionary graphs belonging to a growth-plan. Propagation directives are useful for describing both propagation patterns and growth-plans and are therefore endowed with sufficient expressiveness by being given a formal calculus applicable to object-oriented programming in general. A propagation directive is a succinct description of a family of submodels for a given family of data models. >

AB  - With the application of semantic Web service and semantic Grid service, the similarity measure between services are more and more important in the processing of service matching. By formally defining the similarity of semantic services, useful information can be obtained about their similarity and compatibility. In this paper, we propose a concept similarity matching method based on semantic distance in service matching. Uses OWL-S to descript service, the algorithm computes semantic similarity of service in four macro steps. At last, we provide an experimental comparison of our method against traditional similarity measures, and prove empirically the benefits of our approach.

The protocol, called the Persuasive Argument for Multiple Agents (PARMA) Protocol, embodies an earlier theory by the authors of persuasion over action which enables participants to rationally propose, attack, and defend, an action or course of actions (or inaction). We present an outline of both an axiomatic and a denotational semantics, and discuss implementation of the protocol, in the context of both human and artificial agents.

AB  - . The paper gives a formal reconstruction of some fundamental patterns of legal reasoning, intended to reconcile symbolic logic and argumentation theory. Legal norms are represented as unidirectional inference rules which can be combined into arguments. The value of each argument (its qualification as justified, defensible, or defeated) is determined by the importance of the rules it contains. Applicability arguments, intended to contest or support the applicability of norms, preference arguments, purporting to establish preference relations among norms, and interpretative arguments are also formalised. All those argument types are connected in a unitary model, which relates legal reasoning to the indeterminacy of legal systems, intended as the possibility to develop incompatible defensible arguments. The model is applied to permissive norms and normative hierarchies, and is implemented in a Prolog program.

AB  - This paper aims to advance the pedagogy of systems engineering by identifying opportunities and challenges in empirical research in the field. After an introduction to how empirical research could be further utilized in systems engineering, this paper discusses challenges faced when conducting empirical research in the field, threats to validity associated with systems engineering data collection, and considerations for empirical mixed-methods research. Two recently completed systems engineering empirical studies are used to illustrate specific examples. Finally, suggestions are given on how a professional society might provide additional support for researchers completing empirical research in systems engineering. The overarching goal of this paper is to describe how the increased use of empirical methods can be used to enrich the quality of research results which will in turn enhance the position of systems engineering as a widely recognized academic field. It is proposed that utilizing well-grounded, valid theory will improve understanding of systems engineering phenomena and advance the maturity of the field. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Syst Eng

AB  - Knowledge representation is at the very core of a radical idea for understanding intelligence. Instead of trying to understand or build brains from the bottom up, its goal is to understand and build intelligent behavior from the top down, putting the focus on what an agent needs to know in order to behave intelligently, how this knowledge can be represented symbolically, and how automated reasoning procedures can make this knowledge available as needed. 

This landmark text takes the central concepts of knowledge representation developed over the last 50 years and illustrates them in a lucid and compelling way. Each of the various styles of representation is presented in a simple and intuitive form, and the basics of reasoning with that representation are explained in detail. This approach gives readers a solid foundation for understanding the more advanced work found in the research literature. The presentation is clear enough to be accessible to a broad audience, including researchers and practitioners in database management, information retrieval, and object-oriented systems as well as artificial intelligence. This book provides the foundation in knowledge representation and reasoning that every AI practitioner needs.

*Authors are well-recognized experts in the field who have applied the techniques to real-world problems

Given a set of existing changes, the mined association rules 1) suggest and predict likely further changes, 2) show up item coupling that is undetectable by program analysis, and 3) can prevent errors due to incomplete changes. After an initial change, our ROSE prototype can correctly predict further locations to be changed; the best predictive power is obtained for changes to existing software. In our evaluation based on the history of eight popular open source projects, ROSE's topmost three suggestions contained a correct location with a likelihood of more than 70 percent.

AB  - The main agenda of Requirements Engineering (RE) is the development of tools, techniques and languages for the elicitation, specification, negotiation, and validation of software requirements. However, this development has traditionally been focused on functional requirements (FRs), rather than non-functional requirements (NFRs). Consequently, NFR approaches developed over the years have been fragmental and there is a lack of clear understanding of the positions of these approaches in the RE process. This paper provides a systematic classification and analysis of 89 NFR approaches.

AB  - In an evolving specification, considerable effort is spent handling recurrent inconsistencies. Detecting and resolving inconsistencies is only part of the problem: a resolved inconsistency might not stay resolved. Frameworks in which inconsistency is tolerated help by allowing resolution to be delayed. However, evolution of a specification may affect both resolved and unresolved inconsistencies. We address these problems by explicitly recording relationships between partial specifications (ViewPoints), representing both resolved and unresolved inconsistencies. We assume that ViewPoints will often be inconsistent with one another, and we ensure that a complete work record is kept, detailing any inconsistencies that have been detected, and what actions, if any, have been taken to resolve them. The work record is then used to reason about the effects of subsequent changes to ViewPoints, without constraining the development process.

AB  - SUMMARY This research analyzes longitudinal empirical data on commercial software applications to test and better understand how software evolves over time, and to measure the likely long-term effects of a software process automation tool on software productivity and quality. The research consists of two parts. First, weuse data from source control systems, defect tracking systems, andarchived project documentation to test a series of hypotheses developed by Belady and Lehman about software evolution. We find empirical support for many of these hypotheses, but not all. We then further analyze the data using moderated regression analysis to discern how software process automation efforts at the research site influenced the software evolution lifecycles of the applications. Our results support the claim that automation has enabled the organization to accomplish more work activities with greater productivity, thereby significantly increasing the functionality of the applications portfolio. Despite the growth in software functionality, the analysis suggests that automation has helped to manage software complexity levels and to improve quality by reducing errors over time. Our models and their results demonstrate how longitudinal empirical software data can be used to reveal the often elusive long-term benefits of investments in software process improvement, and to help managers make more informed resource-allocation decisions.

AB  - Although the benefits of requirements traceability are widely recognized, the actual practice of maintaining a traceability scheme is not always entirely successful. The traceability infrastructure underlying a software system tends to erode over its lifetime, as time-pressured practitioners fail to consistently maintain links and update impacted artifacts each time a change occurs, even with the support of automated systems. This paper proposes a new method of traceability based upon event-notification and is applicable even in a heterogeneous and globally distributed development environment. Traceable artifacts are no longer tightly coupled but are linked through an event service, which creates an environment in which change is handled more efficiently, and artifacts and their related links are maintained in a restorable state. The method also supports enhanced project management for the process of updating and maintaining the system artifacts.

AB  - The doctrine of precedent is one of the most distinctive features of the modern common law. Understanding the operation of precedent is important for our theorizing about the nature of law, since any adequate theory must be compatible with the practice. In this paper I will explore the conventional view of precedent endorsed by practitioners and many legal philosophers alike. I will argue that for all its attractions, it provides a distorted view of the nature of precedent. The distortion grows out of the basic assumption that precedents create rules, and thus that the common law can be understood as a form of rule-based decision-making. Instead, the common law is a form of case-by-case decision-making, and the doctrine of precedent constrains this decision-making by requiring later courts to treat earlier cases as correctly decided. The relevance of earlier cases is not well understood in terms of rules—they are better understood as a special type of reason.

In addition, such systems for e-participation can gather, make available, and analyze the public's contributions to political debate. In this article we discuss a system called Parmenides, which we designed to exploit technological developments to bring democratic processes into the online world. Parmenides is primarily a forum by which government bodies can present policy proposals to the public so that users can submit their opinions on the justification presented for the particular policy. Within Parmenides, the justification for action is structured to exploit a specific representation of persuasive argument based on the use of argumentation schemes and critical questions.

AB  - Today's enterprises demand a high degree of compliance of business processes to meet laws and regulations, such as Sarbanes-Oxley and Basel II. Compliance should be enforced during all phases of business process lifecycle, from the phases of analysis and design to deployment, monitoring and evaluation. In this paper, a taxonomy of compliance constraints for business processes is introduced based on the notion of compliance patterns. Patterns facilitate the formal specification of compliance constraints that enable their verification and analysis against business process models. This taxonomy serves as the backbone of the root-cause analysis, which is conducted to reason about and eventually to resolve design-time compliance violations, by providing appropriate guidelines as remedies to alleviate design-time compliance deviations. We have developed and integrated a set of tools to observe and evaluate the applicability of our approach, and experiment with it in case studies.

AB  - Sense-making software for crime investigation should be based on a model of reasoning about evidence that is both natural and rationally well-founded. A formal model is proposed that combines artificial intelligence formalisms for abductive inference to the best explanation and for defeasible argumentation. Stories about what might have happened in a case are represented as causal networks and possible hypotheses can be inferred by abductive reasoning. Links between stories and the available evidence are expressed with evidential generalizations that express how observations can be inferred from evidential sources with defeasible argumentation. It is argued that this approach unifies two well-known accounts of reasoning about evidence, namely, anchored narratives theory and new evidence theory. After the reasoning model is defined, a design is presented for sense-making software that allows crime investigators to visualize their thinking about a case in terms of the reasoning model.

AB  - In the last decade ‘sectoral systems of innovation’ have emerged as a new approach in innovation studies. This article makes four contributions to the approach by addressing some open issues. The first contribution is to explicitly incorporate the user side in the analysis. Hence, the unit of analysis is widened from sectoral systems of innovation to socio-technical systems. The second contribution is to suggest an analytical distinction between systems, actors involved in them, and the institutions which guide actor’s perceptions and activities. Thirdly, the article opens up the black box of institutions, making them an integral part of the analysis. Institutions should not just be used to explain inertia and stability. They can also be used to conceptualise the dynamic interplay between actors and structures. The fourth contribution is to address issues of change from one system to another. The article provides a coherent conceptual multi-level perspective, using insights from sociology, institutional theory and innovation studies. The perspective is particularly useful to analyse long-term dynamics, shifts from one socio-technical system to another and the co-evolution of technology and society.

AB  - Argumentation is the process by which arguments are constructed and handled. Argumentation constitutes a major component of human intelligence. The ability to engage in argumentation is essential for humans to understand new problems, to perform scientific reasoning, to express, to clarify and to defend their opinions in their daily lives. Argumentation mining aims to detect the arguments presented in a text document, the relations between them and the internal structure of each individual argument. In this paper we analyse the main research questions when dealing with argumentation mining and the different methods we have studied and developed in order to successfully confront the challenges of argumentation mining in legal texts.

AB  - The increasing complexity of IT systems and the growing demand for regulation compliance are main issues for the design of IT systems. Addressing these issues requires the developing of effective methods to support the analysis of regulations and the elicitation of any organizational and system requirements from them. This work investigates the problem of designing regulation-compliant systems and, in particular, the challenges in eliciting and managing legal requirements.

AB  - Qualifying strategic opportunities to pursue and capitalizing on those opportunities is key to the very survival of an organization. Successful organizations that thrive on contract work capture contracts and earn a profit executing those contracts. Systems engineers are generally the “cradle to grave” technical points of contact for projects and are charged with guiding the definition of the technical solutions in the early lifecycle stages. This paper examines existing research that may guide systems engineering in support of bid and proposal pursuits. Systems engineering, software engineering, bid management, economics, finance, game theory, and cognitive psychology literature are all mined for areas related to bidding. As a result, a number of research opportunities are identified. © 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Syst Eng 14

AB  - Accredited and non-accredited standards organizations, commonly referred to as ldquoSDOsrdquo and ldquoSSOsrdquo respectively, are more alike than usually thought. Both rely on volunteers to provide their time and effort and to apply their domain expertise to create industry, national, and international standards. Both face similar challenges with regards to IPR issues, governance, business models, membership recruitment and retention, and promotion of work products. Accreditation by itself is not a valid distinguishing feature; many unaccredited organizations are fully qualified to become accredited and would do so if only they saw the need or benefit. The perceived differences between these types of organizations, while loosely based on historical practices, depend mostly upon whom one asks. In addition, the two types of organizations are becoming more like each other as their practices become more closely aligned and as they reach out to work with each other, recognizing the value of each otherspsila efforts.

AB  - Use cases and scenarios have emerged as prominent analysis tools during requirements engineering activities due to both their richness and informality. In some instances, for example when a project’s budget or schedule time is reduced at short notice, practitioners have been known to adopt a collection of use cases as a suitable substitute for a requirements specification. Given the challenges inherent in managing large collections of scenarios, this shortcut is cause for concern and deserves focused attention. We describe our experiences during a goal-driven requirements analysis effort for an electronic commerce application. In particular, we identify the specific risks incurred, focusing more on the challenges imposed due to traceability, inconsistent use of terminology, incompleteness and consistency, rather than on traditional software project management risks. We conclude by discussing the impact of the lessons learned for requirements engineering in the context of building quality systems during goal and scenario analysis

AB  - Compliance of an organization's business processes with legislation is difficult to assess, and even more so as laws and processes evolve. Using seven criteria, we evaluate five different approaches for documenting and managing such compliance that involve models and/or legal documents, with or without tool support for traceability. It is argued that a mixed approach that combines models and original documents, with tool support, offers the best trade-off. We also discuss an example of such an approach based on the user requirements notation and a commercial requirements management system.

AB  - Abstract   Collaborative decision making problems can be addressed through argumentative discourse and collaboration among the users involved. Consensus is achieved through the process of collaboratively considering alternative understandings of the problem, competing interests, priorities and constraints. The application of formal modeling and analysis tools to solve the related processes is impossible before the problem can be articulated in a concise and agreed upon manner. This paper describes H ermes , a system that augments classical decision making approaches by supporting argumentative discourse among decision makers. It is fully implemented in Java and runs on the Web, thus providing relatively inexpensive access to a broad public. Using an illustrative example, we present the argumentation elements, discourse acts and reasoning mechanisms involved in H ermes . We also describe the integration of advanced features to the system; these enable users to retrieve data stored in remote databases in order to further warrant their arguments, and stimulate them to perform acts that best reflect their interests and intentions.

AB  - Much work using argumnentation frameworks treats arguments as entirely abstract, related by a uniform attack relation which always succeeds unless the attacker can itself be defeated. However, this does not seem adequate for legal argumentation. Some proposals have suggested regulating attack relations using preferences or values on arguments and which filter the attack relation, so that some attacks fail and so can be removed from the framework. This does not capture several important context related features of legal reasoning, such as how an audience can prefer or value an argument, yet be constrained by precedent or authority not to accept it. Nor does it explain how certain types of attack may not be allowed in a particular procedural context. For this reason, evaluation of the status of arguments within a given framework must be allowed to depend not only on the attack relations along with the preference or value of arguments, but also on the nature of the attacks and the context in which they are made. We present a means to represent these features, enabling us to account for a number of factors currently considered to be beyond the remit of formal argumentation frameworks. We give three examples of the use of approach: appealing a case, overruling a precedent, and rehearing of a case as a civil rather than criminal proceeding.

AB  - Understanding how to better elicit, specify, and manage requirements for secure and usable software systems is a key challenge in security software engineering, however, there lacks tool-support for specifying and managing the voluminous amounts of data the associated analysis yields. Without these tools, the subjectivity of analysis may increase as design activities progress. This paper describes CAIRIS Computer Aided Integration of Requirements and Information Security, a step toward tool-support for usable secure requirements engineering. CAIRIS not only manages the elements associated with task, requirements, and risk analysis, it also supports subsequent analysis using novel approaches for analysing and visualising security and usability. The authors illustrate an application of CAIRIS by describing how it was used to support requirements analysis in a critical infrastructure case study.

AB  - Software change impact analysis has gained considerable attention with recent challenges of the Year 2000 Date situation. As the software community recognizes the growing need to identify consequences of these changes, impact analysis is making its way into the software process. Dependencies between software life cycle objects are becoming more numerous and complex as many software systems grow beyond a million of lines of code. Software change efforts are plagued with widely varying estimates for implementing software changes, since the impacts of the change are not readily known in advance. The introduction of software change impact analysis into the software process adds more fidelity to software change visibility, enabling more accurate software change estimates. The paper examines where impact analysis is applied during software changes and describes how impact analysis can be addressed in the software process.

AB  - SCALIR is a legal information retrieval system which uses a combination of symbolic and connectionist artificial intelligence techniques. Traditional systems used for automating legal research have many difficulties which make them “brittle”; SCALIR is an attempt to rectify many of these problems. SCALIR's hybrid nature is especially appropriate for the legal domain, which requires both logical and associative inferences. The system also benefits from a unique direct-manipulation style interface and the ability to improve its performance based on user feedback.

AB  - It has long been realized that in pulse-code modulation (PCM), with a given ensemble of signals to handle, the quantum values should be spaced more closely in the voltage regions where the signal amplitude is more likely to fall. It has been shown by Panter and Dite that, in the limit as the number of quanta becomes infinite, the asymptotic fractional density of quanta per unit voltage should vary as the one-third power of the probability density per unit voltage of signal amplitudes. In this paper the corresponding result for any finite number of quanta is derived; that is, necessary conditions are found that the quanta and associated quantization intervals of an optimum finite quantization scheme must satisfy. The optimization criterion used is that the average quantization noise power be a minimum. It is shown that the result obtained here goes over into the Panter and Dite result as the number of quanta become large. The optimum quautization schemes for 2^{b} quanta, b=1,2, \cdots, 7 , are given numerically for Gaussian and for Laplacian distribution of signal amplitudes.

AB  - Goals capture, at different levels of abstraction, the various objectives the system under consideration should achieve. Goal-oriented requirements engineering is concerned with the use of goals for eliciting, elaborating, structuring, specifying, analyzing, negotiating, documenting, and modifying requirements. This area has received increasing attention. The paper reviews various research efforts undertaken along this line of research. The arguments in favor of goal orientation are first briefly discussed. The paper then compares the main approaches to goal modeling, goal specification and goal-based reasoning in the many activities of the requirements engineering process. To make the discussion more concrete, a real case study is used to suggest what a goal-oriented requirements engineering method may look like. Experience, with such approaches and tool support are briefly discussed as well.

A Web-based library of these cost estimation papers is provided to ease the identification of relevant estimation research results. The review results combined with other knowledge provide support for recommendations for future software cost estimation research, including: 1) increase the breadth of the search for relevant studies, 2) search manually for relevant papers within a carefully selected set of journals when completeness is essential, 3) conduct more studies on estimation methods commonly used by the software industry, and 4) increase the awareness of how properties of the data sets impact the results when evaluating estimation methods

AB  - In this paper we present our systems for the STS task. Our systems are all based on a simple process of identifying the components that correspond between two sentences. Currently we use words (that is word forms), lemmas, distributional similar words and grammatical relations identified with a dependency parser. We submitted three systems. All systems only use open class words. Our first system (alignheuristic) tries to obtain a mapping between every open class token using all the above sources of information. Our second system (wordsim) uses a different algorithm and unlike alignheuristic, it does not use the dependency information. The third system (average) simply takes the average of the scores for each item from the other two systems to take advantage of the merits of both systems. For this reason we only provide a brief description of that. The results are promising, with Pearson's coefficients on each individual dataset ranging from .3765 to .7761 for our relatively simple heuristics based systems that do not require training on different datasets. We provide some analysis of the results and also provide results for our data using Spearman's, which as a nonparametric measure which we argue is better able to reflect the merits of the different systems (average is ranked between the others).

AB  - One of the most chronic problems in software development is the fact that application requirements are almost never stable and fixed. Frequent changes in requirements are not always caused by capricious clients (although sometimes they are). The root cause of requirements volatility is that many applications are attempting to automate domains that are only partly understood. As software design and development proceeds, the process of automation begins to expose these ill-defined situations. Therefore, although creeping requirements are troublesome, they are often a technical necessity. Several threads of research and some emerging technologies are aimed at either clarifying requirements earlier in development or minimizing the disruptive effect of changing requirements later.

AB  - Use case diagrams (L. Jacobson et al., 1992) have proven quite helpful in requirements engineering, both for eliciting requirements and getting a better overview of requirements already stated. However, not all kinds of requirements are equally well supported by use case diagrams. They are good for functional requirements, but poorer at e.g., security requirements, which often concentrate on what should not happen in the system. With the advent of e- and m-commerce applications, security requirements are growing in importance, also for quite simple applications where a short lead time is important. Thus, it would be interesting to look into the possibility for applying use cases on this arena. The paper suggests how this can be done, extending the diagrams with misuse cases. This new construct makes it possible to represent actions that the system should prevent, together with those actions which it should support.

AB  - This article carries out a formal study of dialogue games for argumentation. A formal framework for such games is proposed which imposes an explicit reply structure on dialogues, where each dialogue move either attacks or surrenders to some earlier move of the other participant. The framework is flexible in several respects. It allows for different underlying logics, alternative sets of locutions and more or less strict rules for when they are allowed. In particular, it allows for varying degrees of coherence and flexibility when it comes to maintaining the focus of a dialogue. Its formal nature supports the study of formal properties of specific dialogue protocols, especially on how they respect the underlying logic.

In an exploratory case study, we interviewed four software immigrants, in order to characterize their naturalization process. Seven patterns in four major categories were found. In this paper, these patterns are substantiated, and their implications discussed. The lessons learned from this study can be applied equally to improving the naturalization process, and to the formulation of further research questions.

AB  - The need to make default assumptions is frequently encountered in reasoning about incompletely specified worlds. Inferences sanctioned by default are best viewed as beliefs which may well be modified or rejected by subsequent observations. It is this property which leads to the non-monotonicity of any logic of defaults.

In this paper we propose a logic for default reasoning. We then specialize our treatment to a very large class of commonly occuring defaults. For this class we develop a complete proof theory and show how to interface it with a top down resolution theorem prover. Finally, we provide criteria under which the revision of derived beliefs must be effected.

This mathematical approach is based on the notion of specificity introduced by Poole and the general theory of warrant as presented by Pollock. General background information on the subject of Nonmonotonic Reasoning is presented and some of the shortcomings of existing systems are analyzed. We believe that the approach presented here represents a definite improvement over past systems.
The main contribution of this thesis is a formally precise, elegant, clean, well-defined system which exhibits a correct behavior when applied to the benchmark examples in the literature. Model-theoretic semantical issues have been addressed. The investigation on the theoretical issues has aided the study of how this kind of reasoner can be realized on a computer. An interpreter of a restricted language, an extension of Horn clauses with defeasible rules, has been implemented. Finally, the implementation details are discussed.

AB  - A theory of analogical mapping between source and target analogs based upon interacting structural, semantic, and pragmatic constraints is proposed here. The structural constraint of isomorphism encourages mappings that maximize the consistency of relational corresondences between the elements of the two analogs. The constraint of semantic similarity supports mapping hypotheses to the degree that mapped predicates have similar meanings. The constraint of pragmatic centrality favors mappings involving elements the analogist believes to be important in order to achieve the purpose for which the analogy is being used. The theory is implemented in a computer program called ACME (Analogical Constraint Mapping Engine), which represents constraints by means of a network of supporting and competing hypotheses regarding what elements to map. A cooperative algorithm for parallel constraint satisfaction identities mapping hypotheses that collectively represent the overall mapping that best fits the interacting constraints. ACME has been applied to a wide range of examples that include problem analogies, analogical arguments, explanatory analogies, story analogies, formal analogies, and metaphors. ACME is sensitive to semantic and pragmatic information if it is available, and yet able to compute mappings between formally isomorphic analogs without any similar or identical elements. The theory is able to account for empirical findings regarding the impact of consistency and similarity on human processing of analogies.

AB  - Security certification activities for software systems rely heavily on requirements mandated by regulatory documents and their compliance evidences to support accreditation decisions. Therefore, the design of a workbench to support these activities should be grounded in a thorough understanding of the characteristics of certification requirements and their relationships with certification activities. To this end, we utilize our findings from the case study of a certification process of The United States Department of Defense (DoD) to identify the design objectives of a requirements-driven workbench for supporting certification analysts. The primary contributions of this paper are: identifying key areas of automation and tool support for requirements-driven certification activities; an ontology-driven dynamic and flexible workbench architecture to address process variability; and a prototype implementation.

AB  - Information technology misuse has increased the vulnerability of personal data, which has lead to growing concern about issues of personal privacy among political leaders, IT managers, information security consultants and the millions of people currently online. Many countries have developed, or are preparing, laws and regulations to combat the related threats and to guarantee personal data protection. Despite efforts to construct secure systems, few papers have, as yet, focused on security from the very outset of the system development life-cycle. This paper presents a pragmatic proposal to incorporate the legal and regulatory measures to guarantee personal data protection as a part of the requirements engineering process, instead of an addendum to system deployment. The authors investigate how recent efforts in the requirements engineering field can contribute to improving security issues in information systems, in particular those dealing with personal data. A reusable collection of security requirements and, as a novelty, personal data protection requirements (including information on related software components links) are provided. The pre-defined requirements, together with a simple process model based on requirements reuse, provide a strategy that organizations can use to become privacy-compliant.

AB  - Requirements are usually understood as stating what a system is supposed to do, as apposed to how it should do it. However, understanding the organizational context and rationales (the "Whys") that lead up to systems requirements can be just as important for the ongoing success of the system. Requirements modelling techniques can be used to help deal with the knowledge and reasoning needed in this earlier phase of requirements engineering. However most existing requirements techniques are intended more for the later phase of requirements engineering, which focuses on completeness, consistency, and automated verification of requirements. In contrast, the early phase aims to model and analyze stakeholder interests and how they might be addressed, or compromised, by various system-and-environment alternatives. This paper argues, therefore, that a different kind of modelling and reasoning support is needed for the early phase. An outline of the i* framework is given as an example of a step in this direction. Meeting scheduling is used as a domain example.

AB  - Natural language is the most used representation for stating requirements on computer-based systems in industry. However, natural language is inherently ambiguous. Customers and software developers can disagree on the interpretation of a requirement without being aware of this fact. This disagreement can result in disastrous software failures. We argue that ambiguity is a more complex phenomenon than is often recognized in the literature. While inconsistencies and some types of incompleteness can be mechanically detected in formal specifications, ambiguities in informal specicifications often result in incorrect formal specifications. These misinterpretations can be detected only by execution or inspection of the formal specification. We suggest an inspection technique for detecting ambiguities in informal requirement documents before formal specifications are produced in order to avoid misinterpretations, rather than searching for them afterwards. We show how this technique can be tailored to different project contexts with the help of metamodels to increase its effectiveness. Finally, we report on experimental validation of the technique.

Our work rests on two main theoretical principles: the concept of modular documents, consisting of content elements that can exist and be published independently and are linked by meaningful relations, and the use of semantic data standards allowing access to heterogeneous data. We discuss the application of these concepts in five different projects: a modular format for physics articles, an XML encyclopedia in pharmacology, a semantic data integration project, a modular format for computer science proceedings papers, and our current work on research articles in cell biology.

AB  - The process of E-type software development and evolution has proven most difficult to improve, possibly due to the fact that the process is a multi-input, multi-output system involving feedback at many levels. This observation, first recorded in the early 1970s during an extended study of OS/360 evolution, was recently captured in a FEAST (Feedback, Evolution And Software Technology) hypothesis: a hypothesis being studied in on-going two-year project, FEAST/1. Preliminary conclusions based on a study of a financial transaction system-Logica's Fastwire (FW)-are outlined and compared with those reached during the earlier OS/360 study. The new analysis supports, or better does not contradict, the laws of software evolution, suggesting that the 1970s approach to metric analysis of software evolution is still relevant today. It is hoped that FEAST/1 will provide a foundation for mastering the feedback aspects of the software evolution process, opening up new paths for process modelling and improvement.

AB  - The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) presents an important challenge to the healthcare system in its evolution from a cottage industry to a new, yet-to-be determined form. To guide the system rationally requires clinical research on a massive scale. Will HIPAA stimulate an advance in medical research so that we have evidence to guide our medical decisions and policies, or will it lead to Draconian restrictions that push the healthcare system toward a less rational, less informed approach?

Medical practice evolved in the 20th century from an almost purely anecdote-based apprenticeship system to a system in which doctors were trained by learning the mechanisms of disease and serving apprenticeships in which they learned the “tools of the trade.” Records were kept on paper and, although classification of disorders has been critical to all areas of scientific study, attention to nomenclature has been largely unsystematic in medicine. In parallel, a complex array of computerized systems has been developed for the business side of medicine, with little connection to the actual delivery of care. The dissociation between clinical and billing systems reflects the incorrect idea, basic in medical training, that doctors, armed with knowledge of disease mechanisms, can practice medicine by using deductive reasoning with little need for empirical decision support.

Most recently, the Internet and supporting information systems have revolutionized the nonmedical world. Compare the functioning of the banking industry versus that of the healthcare industry. Almost anyone with a bank account can withdraw funds or pay bills from anywhere on Earth via computer. Making sensitive information about people’s finances available is possible because of common nomenclature and data standards adopted by the finance industry. In contrast, the medical community is a haphazard mix of paper- and computer-based systems with multiple nomenclatures that do not allow the …

This forms a part of our more ambitious goal of automatic legal text summarization. We created a large training and test corpus from court decision reports in Australia. We showed that, within less than a week, it is possible to develop a good quality knowledge base which considerably outperforms a baseline Machine Learning approach. We note that the problem of legal citation classification allows the use of Machine Learning as classified training data is available. For other subproblems of legal text summarization this is unlikely to be the case.

AB  - This paper describes the design of and experimentation with the Knowledge Query and Manipulation Language (KQML), a new language and protocol for exchanging information and knowledge. This work is part of a larger effort, the ARPA Knowledge Sharing Effort which is aimed at developing techniques and methodology for building large-scale knowledge bases which are sharable and reusable. KQML is both a message format and a message-handling protocol to support run-time knowledge sharing among agents. KQML focuses on an extensible set of  performatives , which defines the permissible “speech acts” agents may use and comprise a substrate on which to develop higher-level models of interagent interaction such as contract nets and negotiation. In addition, KQML provides a basic architecture for knowledge sharing through a special class of agent called  communication facilitors  which coordinate the interactions of other agents. The ideas which underlie the evolving design of KQML are currently being explored through experimental prototype systems which are being used to support several testbeds in such areas as concurrent engineering, intelligent design and intelligent planning and scheduling.

AB  - Over the last decades the rise of forensic sciences has led to an increase in the availability of statistical evidence. Reasoning about statistics and probabilities in a forensic science setting can be a precarious exercise, especially so when independencies between variables are involved. To facilitate the correct explanation of such evidence we investigate how argumentation models can help in the interpretation of statistical information. In this paper we focus on the connection between argumentation models and Bayesian belief networks, the latter being a common model to represent and reason with complex probabilistic information. We introduce the notion of a support graph as an intermediate structure between Bayesian networks and argumentation models. A support graph disentangles the complicating graphical properties of a Bayesian network and enhances its intuitive interpretation. Moreover, we show that this model can provide a suitable template for argumentative analysis. Especially in the context of legal reasoning, the correct treatment of statistical evidence is important.

We start by defining a measurement structure model that identifies the elementary component of measures and the measurement process, and then consider five other models involved in measurement: unit definition models, instrumentation models, attribute relationship models, measurement protocols and entity population models. We consider a number of measures from the viewpoint of our measurement validation framework and identify a number of shortcomings; in particular we identify a number of problems with the construction of function points. We also compare our view of measurement validation with ideas presented by other researchers and identify a number of areas of disagreement. Finally, we suggest several rules that practitioners and researchers can use to avoid measurement problems, including the use of measurement vectors rather than artificially contrived scalars.

Some sample dialogues are analysed of types of situations where such a shift may occur, viz. reasoning with defeasible rules, reasoning with argumentation schemes and reasoning with mere presumptions. It is argued that whether a shift in the burden of proof occurs can itself become the subject of dispute and it is shown how a dialogue game protocol for persuasion can be extended to let it regulate persuasion dialogues about the burden of proof. It is also shown that dialogues about the burden of proof are often implicitly about the precise form of the rules used in an argument.

The review identified 564 publications from the SCOPUS, IEEEXPLORE, and ACM DL databases, as well as Google. We selected and extracted data from 26 of those publications. The selected publications contain 30 empirical studies. These studies were designed to test 43 elicitation techniques and 50 different response variables. We got 100 separate results from the experiments. The aggregation generated 17 pieces of knowledge about the interviewing, laddering, sorting, and protocol analysis elicitation techniques. We provide a set of guidelines based on the gathered pieces of knowledge.

The content is based on the authors' own experience from conducting and reading case studies. The terminology and guidelines are compiled from different methodology handbooks in other research domains, in particular social science and information systems, and adapted to the needs in software engineering.

The competing demands and attractions of these two concerns must be appropriately balanced. Failure to balance them harms our work. Certainly it must take some of the blame for the gulf between researchers and practitioners in software development. To achieve proper balance we must sometimes fight against tendencies and inclinations that are deeply ingrained in our customary practices and attitudes in software development. In this paper some aspects of the relationship between the world and the machine are explored; some sources of distortion are identified; and some suggestions are put forward for maintaining a proper balance.

AB  - Knowledge acquisition is undoubtedly one of the major bottle-necks in the development of legal expert systems. Usually the knowledge is collected by knowledge engineers who are forced to make their own interpretations of the knowledge in order to map it on a knowledge representation technique, thus resulting into erroneous and legally unacceptable interpretations of the law. The aim of NOMOS (an EC supported project under the ESPRIT II initiative) was to assist the knowledge engineer by providng tools that perform semi-automatic knowledge acquisition from legal texts in Italian and French. This paper reports on the results of the first evaluation of the knowledge collected by these tools. The evaluation was performed by complementing the tools with a fully functional expert system  that accepted the generated knowledge bases and allowed experts to test the completeness of the knowledge through a series of interactive consultations. The knowledge base used for this evaluation was derived from the text for the Italian Value Added Tax Law. The text was pre-processed in its ASCII form by the Nomos tools and the generated knowledge base was filtered through to a conventional expert system shell to generate the evaluation expert system.  Knowledge extracted directly from text was converted into a hybrid of production rules and Conceptual Graphs. [see SOWA 1984] Knowledge collected from other sources, such as previously resolved cases, explanations of terms and examples, were linked to the knowledge base using an automated hypertext technique. [see KONSTANTINOU  &  MORSE 1992] Finally, the expert system was tested using real-life cases supplied by the Italian ministry of finance.

At the same time, there is a number of laws, for example the Automobile Safety Act, that has to be obeyed by the specification. We give insights into the current state of practice about how the automotive industry performs requirements engineering in order to comply with government laws and regulations. We analyse the challenges, and give ideas from research work in progress for tackling them.

AB  - The IEEE standard for the systems engineering process is problematic when applied to the design of (socio-technical) systems. This is argued using examples of automated vehicle systems. A conceptualization of socio-technical systems is introduced. This distinguishes technical and social elements and agents, as well as four kinds of relations. Next to physical and functional relations, intentional and normative relations play an important role. The IEEE standard defines social elements as contextual and focuses on total design control. Because of the involvement of agents and social elements in socio-technical systems both these viewpoints are problematic.

AB  - In early phases of the software cycle, requirements prioritization necessarily relies on the specified requirements and on predictions of benefit and cost of individual requirements. This paper presents results of a systematic review of literature, which investigates how existing methods approach the problem of requirements prioritization based on benefit and cost. From this review, it derives a set of under-researched issues which warrant future efforts and sketches an agenda for future research in this area.

AB  - We perform a survey into the scope and utility of opinion mining in legal Weblogs (a.k.a. blawgs). The number of 'blogs' in the legal domain is growing at a rapid pace and many potential applications for opinion detection and monitoring are arising as a result. We summarize current approaches to opinion mining before describing different categories of blawgs and their potential impact on the law and the legal profession. In addition to educating the community on recent developments in the legal blog space, we also conduct some introductory opinion mining trials. We first construct a Weblog test collection containing blog entries that discuss legal search tools. We subsequently examine the performance of a language modeling approach deployed for both subjectivity analysis (i.e., is the text subjective or objective?) and polarity analysis (i.e., is the text affirmative or negative towards its subject?). This work may thus help establish early baselines for these core opinion mining tasks.

AB  - This paper takes an argumentation approach to find the place of trust in a method for evaluating arguments from expert opinion. The method uses the argumentation scheme for argument from expert opinion along with its matching set of critical questions. It shows how to use this scheme in three formal computational argumentation models that provide tools to analyse and evaluate instances of argument from expert opinion. The paper uses several examples to illustrate the use of these tools. A conclusion of the paper is that from an argumentation point of view, it is better to critically question arguments from expert opinion than to accept or reject them based solely on trust.

AB  - In a document retrieval, or other pattern matching environment where stored entities (documents) are compared with each other or with incoming patterns (search requests), it appears that the best indexing (property) space is one where each entity lies as far away from the others as possible; in these circumstances the value of an indexing system may be expressible as a function of the density of the object space; in particular, retrieval performance may correlate inversely with space density. An approach based on space density computations is used to choose an optimum indexing vocabulary for a collection of documents. Typical evaluation results are shown, demonstating the usefulness of the model.

AB  - One of the most significant series of experiments in AI and law is the investigation of case based reasoning carried out in the HYPO, CABERET and CATO projects. It is important to understand what has been achieved in these experiments, and this requires that the techniques be applied to a variety of domains. The techniques are not, however, straightforward to apply. In order to provide an experimental environment for investigating the techniques further, we have re-implemented the central argument generation process as a set of agents written in Java using IBM's Aglet agent building framework. By using this environment it will be possible to explore the general applicability of the techniques. In this paper we give a summary of an algorithmic description of argument building in HYPO and CATO, and describe our implementation of the algorithm.

AB  - Time-to-market deadlines and budgetary restrictions require stakeholders to carefully prioritize requirements and determine which ones to implement in a given product release. Unfortunately, existing prioritization techniques do not provide sufficient automation for large projects with hundreds of stakeholders and thousands of potentially conflicting requests and requirements. This paper therefore describes a new approach for automating a significant part of the prioritization process. The proposed method utilizes data-mining and machine learning techniques to prioritize requirements according to stakeholders’ interests, business goals, and cross-cutting concerns such as security or performance requirements. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated and evaluated through two case studies based on the requirements of the Ice Breaker System, and also on a set of stakeholders’ raw feature requests mined from the discussion forum of an open source product named SugarCRM.

AB  - An abstract argument system or argumentation framework, as introduced in a seminal paper by Dung [13], is simply a pair 〈A ,R〉 consisting of a set A whose elements are called arguments and of a binary relation R on A called attack relation. The set A may be finite or infinite in general, however, given the introductory purpose of this chapter, we will restrict the presentation to the case of finite sets of arguments. An argumentation framework has an obvious representation as a directed graph where nodes are arguments and edges are drawn from attacking to attacked arguments. A simple example of argumentation framework AF1 = 〈{a,b},{(b,a)}〉 is shown in Figure 1. While the word argument may recall several intuitive meanings, like the ones of “line of reasoning leading from some premise to a conclusion” or of “utterance in a dispute”, abstract argument systems are not (even implicitly or indirectly) bound to any of them: an abstract argument is not assumed to have any specific structure but, roughly speaking, an argument is anything that may attack or be attacked by another argument. Accordingly, the argumentation framework depicted in Figure 1 is suitable to represent many different situations. For instance, in a context of reasoning about weather, argument a may be associated with the inferential step

The main goal is the process ontology matching, based on ontologies derived from business process models and regulations, rules and policies. The paper introduces a method using ontology building and matching for compliance checking on business processes partway automatically. The objective of this approach is to transform the business process into process ontology and to build reference process ontology from unstructured documents in order to apply ontology matching procedure to restructure, validate and improve the business process. Processes in public administration are also complex and changing fast according to the changes in regulatory environment. In the case study, we illustrate the methodology related to the process of “Assessment of the KICs past performance”, to improve the process at the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT).

In this paper we try to answer a radically different question: Can a technical solution (e.g. a requirement in a security and dependability pattern) be implemented by legal means? We show how Legal Patterns, that represent the legal analogy of Software Patterns, can be formally used to implement trust relations required by security and dependability patterns.

AB  - In this paper we describe a novel approach to reasoning with cases and precedents. The approach is intended to address two main problems. First we find that current case based reasoning systems tend to offer relatively little support in determining the outcome of a case. They either present a list of cases which may inform, but cannot determine, the outcome, or else, as in HYPO and its successors ((1), (2), (3)), present arguments for both sides of a question leaving it the user to decide which is the more persuasive. What is lacking from these accounts is a notion of what it is that makes an argument persuasive. This is addressed in the context of AI and Law by Berman and Hafner in (4), and in law generally by Perelman (e.g. (5)). For Berman and Hafner an argument is made persuasive by supporting the purposes that the law is designed for, and for Perelman it is by advancing or protecting values that its audience subscribes to (on teleological argument, see also (6)). We believe these things to be effectively the same: the purpose of a law is typically to advance or promote some desired value, and the audience is the community subject to the law. Thus our first goal is to provide a model of case based reasoning in which we can use purposes and values to explain disagreements and their resolution. The second problem is the lack of the notion of context in many of the existing case based reasoning systems. A given case is decided in the context both of relevant past cases, which can supply precedents which will inform the decision, and in the context of future cases to which it will be relevant and possibly act as a precedent. A case is thus supposed to cohere with both past decisions and future decisions. This context is largely lost if we state the question as being whether one bundle of factors is more similar to the factors of a current case than another bundle, as in HYPO, or whether one rule is preferred to another, as in logical reconstructions of such systems, for example that of (7)). Recognition of context is vital if we are to understand accounts of legal reasoning (e.g. (8)) in which it is 1 This paper represents current on-going work investigating argument in case law.

Developers of electronic commerce, database management, security mechanisms, telecommunication and collaborative systems should be aware of these effects and acknowledge the need for early privacy planning during the requirements definition activity. Public concerns about the collection of personal information by consumer-based Web sites have led most organizations running such sites to establish and publish privacy policies. However, these policies often fail to align with prevalent societal values on one hand and the operational functioning of Web-based applications on the other. Assuming that such misalignments stem from imperfect appreciation of consequences and not an intent to deceive, we discuss concepts, tools and techniques to help requirements engineers and IT policy makers bring policies and system requirements into better alignment. Our objective is to encourage RE researchers and practitioners to adopt a more holistic view of application and system specification, in which a system or application is seen as an engine of policy enforcement and values attainment.

This approach reconciles the approaches of Schucany & Frawley (1973) and of Hollander & Sethuraman (1978) to the problem of two-group concordance. Estimation and test procedures for the population are based on jackknife procedures. Extension to the problem of multiple intergroup concordance when groups have factorial structure is noted.

In this paper, we present REquirements TRacing On-target (RETRO), a special- purpose requirements tracing tool. We discuss how RETRO automates the generation of RTMs and present the results of a study comparing manual RTM generation to RTM generation using RETRO. The study showed that RETRO found significantly more correct links than manual tracing and took only one third of the time to do so.

AB  - Increased popularity of global software engineering (GSE) has resulted in quite a number of research and industrial studies. As the area matures, an increased focus on empirically supported results leads to a greater potential impact on future research and industrial practice. However, since GSE scenarios are diverse, what works in one context might not directly apply in another. Thus it is necessary to understand, how GSE-related empirical findings should be reported to be useful for practitioners and researchers. Furthermore, itdasias important to summarize progress and get the big picture of published research to identify gaps and commonalities. In this paper we analyze differentiating factors of GSE scenarios and offer a classification scheme for describing the context of a GSE study. In addition, we report initial results of a systematic review on GSE-related empirical literature using papers from ICGSE 2006 and 2007, at the same time illustrating and evaluating the proposed scheme.

This problem arises in the context of merging different versions or variants of a business process model or when comparing business process models in order to display their similarities and differences. The paper investigates two approaches to this alignment problem: one based purely on lexical matching of pairs of elements and another based on error-correcting graph matching. Using a set of models taken from real-life scenarios, the paper empirically shows that graph matching techniques yield a significantly higher precision than pure lexical matching, while achieving comparable recall.

AB  - A wide range of inconsistencies can arise during requirements engineering as goals and requirements are elicited from multiple stakeholders. Resolving such inconsistencies sooner or later in the process is a necessary condition for successful development of the software implementing those requirements. The paper first reviews the main types of inconsistency that can arise during requirements elaboration, defining them in an integrated framework and exploring their interrelationships. It then concentrates on the specific case of conflicting formulations of goals and requirements among different stakeholder viewpoints or within a single viewpoint. A frequent, weaker form of conflict called divergence is introduced and studied in depth. Formal techniques and heuristics are proposed for detecting conflicts and divergences from specifications of goals/requirements and of domain properties. Various techniques are then discussed for resolving conflicts and divergences systematically by the introduction of new goals or by transforming the specifications of goals/objects toward conflict-free versions. Numerous examples are given throughout the paper to illustrate the practical relevance of the concepts and techniques presented. The latter are discussed in the framework of the KAOS methodology for goal-driven requirements engineering.

AB  - [Context & motivation] Obtaining traceability among requirements and between requirements and other artifacts is an extremely important activity in practice, an interesting area for theoretical study, and a major hurdle in common industrial experience. Substantial effort is spent on establishing and updating such links in any large project - even more so when requirements refer to a product family. [Question/problem]While most research is concerned with ways to reduce the effort needed to establish and maintain traceability links, a different question can also be asked: how is it possible to harness the vast amount of implicit (and tacit) knowledge embedded in already-established links? Is there something to be learned about a specific problem or domain, or about the humans who establish traces, by studying such traces?

[Principal ideas/results] In this paper, we present preliminary results from a study applying different machine learning techniques to an industrial case study, and test to what degree common hypothesis hold in our case. [Contribution] Reshaping traceability data into knowledge can contribute to more effective automatic tools to suggest candidates for linking, to inform improvements in writing style, and at the same time provide some insight into both the domain of interest and the actual implementation techniques.

By assuming an adversarial setting, we force the players to advance and improve their own explanations as well as criticize their opponent's explanations, thus hopefully preventing the well-known problem of 'tunnel vision'. A main novelty of our approach is that the game supports the combination of argumentation with abductive inference to the best explanation.

AB  - In this paper a dialectical proof theory is proposed for logical systems for defeasible argumentation that fit a certain format. This format is the abstract theory developed by Dung, Kowalski and others A main feature of the proof theory is that it also applies to systems in which reasoning about the standards for comparing arguments is possible The proof theory could serve as the 'logical core' of protocols for dispute in multi-agent decision making processes.

AB  - When identifying and elaborating compliance requirements, analysts need to follow the cross references in legal texts and consider the additional information in the cited provisions. Enabling easier navigation and handling of cross references requires automated support for the detection of the natural language expressions used in cross references, the interpretation of cross references in their context, and the linkage of cross references to the targeted provisions. In this article, we propose an approach and tool support for automated detection and resolution of cross references. The approach leverages the structure of legal texts, formalized into a schema, and a set of natural language patterns for legal cross reference expressions. These patterns were developed based on an investigation of Luxembourg's legislation, written in French. To build confidence about their applicability beyond the context where they were observed, these patterns were validated against the Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA) by the Government of Ontario, Canada, written in both French and English. We report on an empirical evaluation where we assess the accuracy and scalability of our framework over several Luxembourgish legislative texts as well as PHIPA.

AB  - This paper addresses the use of goals to extract non-functional requirements from policy statements. Goals are important precursors to software requirements, but the process of abstracting them from security and policy policies has not been thoroughly researched. We present a summary of a goal-based approach for extracting standard security and privacy requirements from policy statements and illustrate its application to analyze 40 financial privacy policies. We present heuristics to support goal analysis, goal refinement, and the development of tool support, including the establishment of a goal repository that can be used in future goal analyses. To gain a deeper understanding of the goal set, and to identify potential conflicts and inconsistencies between goals, we used i* to model semantic relationships between goals, their actors and strategic dependencies. The goal-based process will assist software engineers in the specification of system requirements that are in alignment an organization’s policies.

AB  - Automotive development faces tightening regulatory requirements, shortening development cycle times, and growing complexity. To cope with such an environment, it is moving from a traditional evolutionary to a systems engineering approach. Great effort is being made for a shift from the traditional component focus, which has been enhanced by concurrent engineering, to a more broadened view supported by systems thinking. This broader view, however, is in practice strongly focused on the product elements of the system. This paper proposes a systems engineering framework for integrated automotive development—the total view approach. It is a modeling framework that integrates the product, its life cycle processes and their associated organizations throughout the requirements, functional and physical analysis processes, at all levels of the product breakdown structure, deriving attributes as emergent properties of a whole integrated system. The paper justifies the framework through a review of traditional and current automotive development and two case studies. A major benefit of the application of the framework is the ability to investigate early in the product development process the interactions between requirements and attributes not only of the product, but also of its life cycle processes and their associated organisations. This can lead to better product quality, lower life cycle cost, shorter development time, and manageable complexity. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Syst Eng 7: 153–166, 2004

AB  - Despite the large body of i* research, there has been com- paratively little work on how goal-modelling techniques can help identify usability concerns. Recent work has considered how goal models might better integrate with User-Centered Design. This paper takes an alterna- tive perspective by examining how work in User-Centered Design, specifi- cally Persona Cases, can be re-framed as goal models. We briefly describe an approach for doing  this,  and present  some preliminary results  from applying this approach using the Goal-oriented Requirements Language and existing tool support.

AB  - Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) measures the degree of semantic equivalence between two texts. This paper presents the results of the STS pilot task in Semeval. The training data contained 2000 sentence pairs from previously existing paraphrase datasets and machine translation evaluation resources. The test data also comprised 2000 sentences pairs for those datasets, plus two surprise datasets with 400 pairs from a different machine translation evaluation corpus and 750 pairs from a lexical resource mapping exercise. The similarity of pairs of sentences was rated on a 0-5 scale (low to high similarity) by human judges using Amazon Mechanical Turk, with high Pearson correlation scores, around 90%. 35 teams participated in the task, submitting 88 runs. The best results scored a Pearson correlation >80%, well above a simple lexical baseline that only scored a 31% correlation. This pilot task opens an exciting way ahead, although there are still open issues, specially the evaluation metric.

AB  - Laws and regulations play an increasingly important role for requirements engineering and system development. The challenge of interpreting the law to elicit legal requirements for a novel application calls for legal expertise. In this paper, we investigate if the effort of compiling a list of legal software requirements can be reduced by reusing recurring legal requirements. Therefore, we collected legal requirements that are stable concerning changes due to their origin in fundamental, higher-ranked laws, and derived software requirement patterns from them. This paper contributes by presenting those software requirement patterns consisting of the name, the goal and the pre-defined requirement template. We argue that under certain circumstances they can be used as a lightweight approach to specify legal requirements in system development projects and hence reduce the need for legal advice.

The framework can be used to determine the level of coverage of concepts provided by CMFs, establish mappings between CMF languages and the semantics for the normative concepts and evaluate the suitability of a CMF for issuing a certification of compliance. The developed framework is independent of any specific formalism and it has been formally defined and validated through the examples of such mappings of CMFs.

AB  - Goal decomposition structures lie at the heart of goal model- ing languages such as i* . High-level goals of stakeholders are recursively decomposed into lower level ones and eventually into leaf level tasks to be performed by agents. The decomposition structure can also develop through a bottom up approach whereby higher-level goals are introduced as justifications for existing low-level ones. The very concept of decom- position, however, both as process and as artefact is rarely questioned in requirements engineering. In this paper, we argue that it may be of value to give a closer look into goal decomposition and clarify what we actually know about it and what is yet to be understood. We report on an on-going effort to identify empirical work on decomposition coming from various research fields, hoping to find such evidence. We then pose some research questions that we believe need to be pursued in order to improve our understanding of goal decomposition.

Furthermore, we introduce preference handling methods for ADFs, allowing for both reasoning with and about preferences. Finally, we present an implementation based on an encoding in answer set programming.

AB  - This paper presents an approach to automatically extract Conceptual Graphs (CGs) from patent documents using Over-Replicated Softmax model of Deep Boltzman Machines (DBMs). The main challenge in the extraction of conceptual graphs from the natural language texts is the automatic identification of concepts and conceptual relations. The text analyzed in this work are patent documents, focused mainly on the claim's section (Claim) of the documents. The task of automatically identifying the concept and conceptual relation becomes difficult due to the complexities in the writing style of these documents as they are technical as well as legal. The analysis we have done shows that the general in-depth parsers available in the open domain fail to parse the 'claims section' sentences in patent documents. The failure of in-depth parsers led us, to develop a methodology to extract CGs using shallow parsed text. Thus in the present work we came up with a methodology which uses shallow parsed text in conjunction with DBMs, a deep learning technique for extracting CGs from sentences in the claim/novelty section of patent documents. The results obtained in our experiments are encouraging with a significant improvement over the state -of-art and are discussed in detail in this paper. We have obtained a precision of 79.34 % and a recall of 72.54%.

It centers on the concept of a value judgment, i.e. a determination that one factual situation is preferable over another by virtue of their respective effects on values. This allows the modeling of legal sources as sets of value judgments and legal methodologies as collections of argumentation schemes. The paper briefly derives the formalism from legal theory and elaborates on its use in the context of an example of hypothetical reasoning.

AB  - In the recent years, different Web knowledge graphs, both free and commercial, have been created. While Google coined the term "Knowledge Graph" in 2012, there are also a few openly available knowledge graphs, with DBpedia, YAGO, and Freebase being among the most prominent ones. Those graphs are often constructed from semi-structured knowledge, such as Wikipedia, or harvested from the web with a combination of statistical and linguistic methods. The result are large-scale knowledge graphs that try to make a good trade-off between completeness and correctness. In order to further increase the utility of such knowledge graphs, various refinement methods have been proposed, which try to infer and add missing knowledge to the graph, or identify erroneous pieces of information. In this article, we provide a survey of such knowledge graph refinement approaches, with a dual look at both the methods being proposed as well as the evaluation methodologies used.

AB  - Laws and regulations safeguard citizens’ security and privacy. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) 1 governs the security and privacy of electronic health records (EHR) systems. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which is charged with creating, maintaining, and enforcing regulations pursuant to HIPAA, has required systematic changes in institutional privacy practices as a result of nearly 15,000 resolved HIPAA investigations.2 HIPAA violations can result in serious monetary penalties. HHS recently fined one healthcare provider $4.3 million dollars for violations of the HIPAA Privacy Rule.3 Ensuring EHR systems are legally compliant is challenging for software engineers because the laws and regulations governing EHR systems are written by lawyers with little to no understanding of the underlying technology. 
This dissertation examines how software engineers can evaluate software requirements for compliance with laws and regulations. The main objective of this work is to help software engineers perform a legal compliance analysis for software intended to be deployed in domains goverened by law by developing empirically validated: (a) techniques for determining which requirements are legally implementation ready (LIR);4 (b) metrics to estimate which requirements are LIR automatically; and (c) a prototype tool that supports identifying LIR requirements using legal requirements metrics. 
My empirical studies suggest that the average graduate-level software engineer is illprepared to identify legally compliant software requirements with any confidence and that domain experts are an absolute necessity. When working together as a team graduate-level software engineers make extremely conservative legal implementation readiness decisions. Furthermore, we observe that the legal requirements metrics discussed in this dissertation can be used to improve legal implementation readiness decisions. These findings, along with legal and ethical concerns, make the study of legal compliance in software engineering a critical area for continued research.

AB  - Motivated by the recent explosion of interest around blockchains, we examine whether they make a good fit for the Internet of Things (IoT) sector. Blockchains allow us to have a distributed peer-to-peer network where non-trusting members can interact with each other without a trusted intermediary, in a verifiable manner. We review how this mechanism works and also look into smart contracts—scripts that reside on the blockchain that allow for the automation of multi-step processes. We then move into the IoT domain, and describe how a blockchain-IoT combination: 1) facilitates the sharing of services and resources leading to the creation of a marketplace of services between devices and 2) allows us to automate in a cryptographically verifiable manner several existing, time-consuming workflows. We also point out certain issues that should be considered before the deployment of a blockchain network in an IoT setting: from transactional privacy to the expected value of the digitized assets traded on the network. Wherever applicable, we identify solutions and workarounds. Our conclusion is that the blockchain-IoT combination is powerful and can cause significant transformations across several industries, paving the way for new business models and novel, distributed applications.

AB  - Dialectical Frameworks for Legal Reasoning Latifa AL-ABDULKARIM, Katie ATKINSON, Trevor BENCH-CAPON Department of Computer Science, The University of Liverpool, UK Abstract. In recent years a powerful generalisation of Dung’s abstract argumentation frameworks, Abstract Dialectical Frameworks (ADF), has been developed. ADFs generalise the abstract argumentation frameworks introduced by Dung by replacing Dung’s single acceptance condition (that all attackers be defeated) with acceptance conditions local to each particular node. Such local acceptance conditions allow structured argumentation to be straightforwardly incorporated. Related to ADFs are prioritised ADFs, which allow for reasons pro and con a node. In this paper we show how these structures provide an excellent framework for representing a leading approach to reasoning with legal cases.

AB  - This paper presents a case study in which an opinion of a legal scholar on a legislative proposal is formally reconstructed in the ASPIC+ framework for argumentation-based inference. The reconstruction uses a version of the argument scheme for good and bad consequences that does not refer to single but to sets of consequences, in order to model aggregation of reasons for and against proposals. The case study is intended to contribute to a comparison between various formal frameworks for argumentation by providing a new benchmark example. It also aims to illustrate the usefulness of two features of ASPIC+: its distinction between deductive and defeasible inference rules and its ability to express arbitrary preference orderings on arguments.

AB  - When reasoning about the facts of a case, we typically use stories to link the known events into coherent wholes. One way to establish coherence is to appeal to past examples, real or fictitious. These examples can be chosen and critiqued using the case-based reasoning (CBR) techniques from the AI and Law literature. In this paper, we apply these techniques to factual stories, assessing a story about the facts using precedents. We thus show how factual and legal reasoning can be combined in a CBR model.

While the original scheme considers only arguments arising from the immediately next state, our proposals will enable long term considerations to be taken into account. We consider the various reasons for and against performing an action that arise from these longer term considerations, and develop a new set of argumentation schemes for practical reasoning which allows a clearer separation between facts, values and preferences, and more precise targeting of attacks.

Identifying and extracting such rules from the language of the source material would be useful for automating rulebook management and translating into an executable logic. The paper presents a linguistically-oriented, rule-based approach, which is in contrast to a machine learning approach. It outlines use cases, discusses the source materials, reviews the methodology, then provides initial results and future steps.

AB  - Semantic relatedness and disambiguation are fundamental problems for linking text documents to the Web of Data. There are many approaches dealing with both problems but most of them rely on word or concept distribution over Wikipedia. They are therefore not applicable to concepts that do not have a rich textual description. In this paper, we show that semantic relatedness can also be accurately computed by analysing only the graph structure of the knowledge base. In addition, we propose a joint approach to entity and word-sense disambiguation that makes use of graph-based relatedness. As opposed to the majority of state-of-the-art systems that target mainly named entities, we use our approach to disambiguate both entities and common nouns. In our experiments, we first validate our relatedness measure on multiple knowledge bases and ground truth datasets and show that it performs better than related state-of-the-art graph based measures. Afterwards, we evaluate the disambiguation algorithm and show that it also achieves superior disambiguation accuracy with respect to alternative state-of-the-art graph-based algorithms.

AB  - In this article we propose a strategy for the summarization of scientific articles that concentrates on the rhetorical status of statements in an article: Material for summaries is selected in such a way that summaries can highlight the new contribution of the source article and situate it with respect to earlier work.We provide a gold standard for summaries of this kind consisting of a substantial corpus of conference articles in computational linguistics annotated with human judgments of the rhetorical status and relevance of each sentence in the articles. We present several experiments measuring our judges' agreement on these annotations.We also present an algorithm that, on the basis of the annotated training material, selects content from unseen articles and classifies it into a fixed set of seven rhetorical categories. The output of this extraction and classification system can be viewed as a single-document summary in its own right; alternatively, it provides starting material for the generation of task-oriented and user-tailored summaries designed to give users an overview of a scientific field.

AB  - As information technology has become more ubiquitous and pervasive, assurance and security concerns have escalated; in response, we have seen noticeable growth in public policy aimed at bolstering cybertrust. With this growth in public policy, questions regarding the effectiveness of these policies arise. This chapter focuses on policy analysis of the state data breach disclosure laws recently enacted in the United States. The state data breach disclosure laws were chosen for policy analysis for three reasons: the rapid policy growth (the United States have enacted 45 state laws in 6 years); this is the first instantiation of informational regulation for information security; and the importance of these laws to identity theft and privacy. The chapter begins with a brief history in order to provide context. Then, this chapter examines the way in which historical, political and institutional factors have shaped our current data breach disclosure policies, focusing on discovering how patterns of interaction influenced the legislative outcomes we see today. Finally, this chapter considers: action that may result from these policies; the action type(s) being targeted; alternatives that are being considered, and; potential outcomes of the existing and proposed alternative policies.

AB  - In this chapter, I explore a view of granular computing as a paradigm of human-inspired problem solving and information processing, covering human-oriented studies and machine-oriented studies. By exploring the notion of multiple levels of granularity, one can identify, examine and formalize a special family of principles, strategies, heuristics, and methods that are commonly used by humans in daily problem solving. The results may then be used for human and machine problem solving, as well as for implementing human-inspired approaches in machines and systems. The triarchic theory of granular computing unifies both types of studies from three perspectives, namely, a philosophy of structured thinking, a methodology of structured problem solving, and a computation paradigm of structured information processing. The stress on multilevel, hierarchical structures makes granular computing a human-inspired and structured approach to problem solving.

AB  - In this paper we show that an essential aspect of solving the problem of uncritical acceptance of expert opinions that is at the root of the ad verecundiam fallacy is the need to disentangle argument from expert opinion from another kind of appeal to authority. Formal and computational argumentation systems enable us to analyze the fault in which an error has occurred by virtue of a failure to meet one or more of the requirements of the argumentation scheme from argument from expert opinion. We present a method for enhancing this capability by showing how arguments from expert opinion are related to, but different from, arguments from deontic authority.

AB  - Information on the Internet is fragmented and presented in different data sources, which makes automatic knowledge harvesting and understanding formidable for machines, and even for humans. Knowledge graphs have become prevalent in both of industry and academic circles these years, to be one of the most efficient and effective knowledge integration approaches. Techniques for knowledge graph construction can mine information from either structured, semi-structured, or even unstructured data sources, and finally integrate the information into knowledge, represented in a graph. Furthermore, knowledge graph is able to organize information in an easy-to-maintain, easy-to-understand and easy-to-use manner.

In this paper, we give a summarization of techniques for constructing knowledge graphs. We review the existing knowledge graph systems developed by both academia and industry. We discuss in detail about the process of building knowledge graphs, and survey state-of-the-art techniques for automatic knowledge graph checking and expansion via logical inferring and reasoning. We also review the issues of graph data management by introducing the knowledge data models and graph databases, especially from a NoSQL point of view. Finally, we overview current knowledge graph systems and discuss the future research directions.

It is noted that this was mainly an ontological challenge to represent some of what made legal reasoning distinctive, which was given less attention than factual similarity in the dominant AI and Law paradigm, deriving from HYPO. The response to their paper is noted and briefly evaluated. A parallel is drawn to a new challenge to provide deep structure to the legal context of textual meaning, drawing on the forthcoming work of two Constitutional law scholars who appear to place some faith in the ways of thinking that AI and Law has developed.

AB  - Recent advances in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning provide us with the tools to build predictive models that can be used to unveil patterns driving judicial decisions. This can be useful, for both lawyers and judges, as an assisting tool to rapidly identify cases and extract patterns which lead to certain decisions. This paper presents the first systematic study on predicting the outcome of cases tried by the European Court of Human Rights based solely on textual content. We formulate a binary classification task where the input of our classifiers is the textual content extracted from a case and the target output is the actual judgment as to whether there has been a violation of an article of the convention of human rights. Textual information is represented using contiguous word sequences, i.e., N-grams, and topics. Our models can predict the court’s decisions with a strong accuracy (79% on average). Our empirical analysis indicates that the formal facts of a case are the most important predictive factor. This is consistent with the theory of legal realism suggesting that judicial decision-making is significantly affected by the stimulus of the facts. We also observe that the topical content of a case is another important feature in this classification task and explore this relationship further by conducting a qualitative analysis.

AB  - Legal documents are the source of norms, guidelines, and rules that often feed into different applications. In this perspective, to foster the need of development and deployment of different applications, it is important to have a sufficiently expressive conceptual framework such that various heterogeneous aspects of norms can be modeled and reasoned with. In this paper, we investigate how to exploit Semantic Web technologies and languages, such as LegalRuleML, to model a legal document. We show how the semantic annotations can be used to empower a business process regulatory compliance system and discuss the challenges of adapting a semantic approach to legal domain.

AB  - The persuasiveness of an argument depends on the values promoted and demoted by the position defended. This idea, inspired by Perelman's work on argumentation, has become a prominent theme in artificial intelligence research on argumentation since the work by Hafner and Berman on teleological reasoning in the law, and was further developed by Bench-Capon in his value-based argumentation frameworks. One theme in the study of value-guided argumentation is the comparison of values. Formal models involving value comparison typically use either qualitative or quantitative primitives. In this paper, techniques connecting qualitative and quantitative primitives recently developed for evidential argumentation are applied to value-guided argumentation. By developing the theoretical understanding of intelligent systems guided by embedded values, the paper is a step towards ethical systems design, much needed in these days of ever more pervasive AI techniques.

AB  - This paper investigates the ways in which graphic design can be understood as a process of inquiry. Although the use of visuals has been widely accepted in research in various fields, researchers in sciences and humanities tend to position graphic design as a communication tool rather than a research strategy. Thus, the main purpose of adopting graphic works is often for visual presentations. As an emerging discipline with a lack of theoretical engagement (Noble & Bestley 2011), graphic design is overshadowed and its functions and implications have not been fully recognized. This essay aims to explicate knowledge from the graphic design process and understand the term 'graphic design' as a research strategy. In so doing, a clear distinction between two research areas which use visuals in their methodologies needs to be identified. The first is graphic design research which directly links to visuals and graphic design practices. This can refer to a practice-led paradigm so that the designer researchers can discover knowledge through their practices. The second is the research that uses visual data and/or visual presentations. This type of research can vary from the sciences to humanities. In order to reposition graphic design in research methodology, it is important to clarify the difference between these two categories. This would offer potential for graphic design to be accepted as a discipline that has its design methodology.

AB  - Over the last two decades, much attention hasbeen paid to the area of Goal-Oriented Requirements Engineering(GORE), where goals are used as a useful conceptualizationto elicit, model and analyze requirements, capturingalternatives and conflicts. Goal modeling has been adaptedand applied to many sub-topics within RE and beyond, suchas agent-orientation, aspect-orientation, business intelligence, model-driven development, security, and so on. Despite extensiveefforts in this field, the RE community lacks a recent, generalsystematic literature review of the area. As a first step towardsproviding a GORE overview, we present a Systematic LiteratureMap, focusing on GORE-related publications at a high-level, categorizing and analyzing paper information in order to answerseveral research questions, while omitting a detailed analysis ofindividual paper quality. Our Literature Map covers the 246 topcitedGORE-related conference and journal papers, accordingto Scopus, classifying them into a number of descriptive papertypes and topics, providing an analysis of the data, which ismade publicly available. We use our analysis results to makerecommendations concerning future GORE research.

AB  - Ambiguity arises in requirements when astatement is unintentionally or otherwise incomplete, missing information, or when a word or phrase has morethan one possible meaning. For web-based and mobileinformation systems, ambiguity, and vagueness inparticular, undermines the ability of organizations to aligntheir privacy policies with their data practices, which canconfuse or mislead users thus leading to an increase inprivacy risk. In this paper, we introduce a theory ofvagueness for privacy policy statements based on ataxonomy of vague terms derived from an empiricalcontent analysis of 15 privacy policies. The taxonomy wasevaluated in a paired comparison experiment and resultswere analyzed using the Bradley-Terry model to yield arank order of vague terms in both isolation andcomposition. The theory predicts how vague modifiers toinformation actions and information types can becomposed to increase or decrease overall vagueness. Wefurther provide empirical evidence based on factorialvignette surveys to show how increases in vagueness willdecrease users' acceptance of privacy risk and thusdecrease users' willingness to share personal information.

AB  - Abstract Knowledge integrated model (KIM) is regarded as an effective and critical way to enhance efficiency of product collaborative development (PCD). However, it is much knotty to establish a unified description rule as there exists diverse and heterogeneous designer knowledge. In this paper, an approach based on ontology for KIM is proposed to straightforwardly descript heterogeneous knowledge and achieve a matching of knowledge and design mission objectives easily. First, a KIM of PCD is presented in accordance with the characteristics of product design activities. Hereafter, a knowledge transformation method based on “problem domain – functional domain” model is developed to accurately reflect customer expectations for new products, wherein, knowledge ontology tree including “customer creativity, emotional knowledge, customer needs, and basic knowledge” is constructed to standardize customer needs. Then, a knowledge matching function (KMF) and a Backus–Naur form (BNF) are introduced to measure similarity of request and candidate. Thereafter, a service engine (SE) including KMF and BNF is generated by the knowledge integrated system (KIS). Finally, simulations and experiments illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and models.

AB  - Standards representation and processing in the United States has had a long and interesting history of                       development. The work in the past has focused primarily on representing a standard, evaluating the intrinsic                       properties of that represented standard, and evaluating designs for conformance to that standard. To date, for a                       variety of reasons, standards writing organizations and computer-aided design software vendors have not                       adopted much of the results of this research. The failure of the approach so far in the U.S. can be traced to two                       distinct areas. One major cluster of causes is methodological: the initial concepts were not backed up by usable,                       persistent computer tools; and the initial application and model were not representative. The second cluster of                       causes of failure is professional, and has a lot to do with the dynamics of interaction of individuals and                       organizations. Future research must address the inadequacies of the current representations and create models                       that are able to represent all, or almost all, of the different types of provisions in any given standard; investigate                       and deliver a much richer set of processing functionality's, such as more support for use of design standards in                       earlier phases of design; support the treatment of multiple, heterogeneous standards available from distributed                       sources; and determine what type of support is needed to go from the textual versions of design standards to the                       formal models that can support sophisticated computation.

AB  - This paper presents a formalisation of two typical legal dialogue moves in a formal dialogue game for argumentation. The moves concern two ways of reinterpret- ing a general rule used in an argument, viz. by 'unpacking' and 'refining' the rule. The moves can be made not only by the user but also by the attacker of the rule, in order to reveal new ways to attack it. The new dialogue game is illustrated with examples from legal evidential reasoning, in which these types of moves are particularly common.

AB  - There is an increasing need for norms to be embedded in technology as the widespread deployment of applications such as autonomous driving, warfare and big data analysis for crime fighting and counter-terrorism becomes ever closer. Current approaches to norms in multi-agent systems tend either to simply make prohibited actions unavailable, or to provide a set of rules (principles) which the agent is obliged to follow, either as part of its design or to avoid sanctions and punishments. In this paper we argue for the position that agents should be equipped with the ability to reason about a system's norms, by reasoning about the social and moral values that norms are designed to serve; that is, perform the sort of moral reasoning we expect of humans. In particular we highlight the need for such reasoning when circumstances are such that the rules should arguably be broken, so that the reasoning can guide agents in deciding whether to comply with the norms and, if violation is desirable, how best to violate them. One approach to enabling this is to make use of an argumentation scheme based on values and designed for practical reasoning: arguments for and against actions are generated using this scheme and agents choose between actions based on their preferences over these values. Moral reasoning then requires that agents have an acceptable set of values and an acceptable ordering on their values. We first discuss how this approach can be used to think about and justify norms in general, and then discuss how this reasoning can be used to think about when norms should be violated, and the form this violation should take. We illustrate how value based reasoning can be used to decide when and how to violate a norm using a road traffic example. We also briefly consider what makes an ordering on values acceptable, and how such an ordering might be determined.

AB  - Evidential reasoning is hard, and errors can lead to miscarriages of justice with serious consequences. Analytic methods for the correct handling of evidence come in different styles, typically focusing on one of three tools: arguments, scenarios or probabilities. Recent research used Bayesian networks for connecting arguments, scenarios, and probabilities. Well-known issues with Bayesian networks were encountered: More numbers are needed than are available, and there is a risk of misinterpretation of the graph underlying the Bayesian network, for instance as a causal model. The formalism presented here models presumptive arguments about coherent hypotheses that are compared in terms of their strength. No choice is needed between qualitative or quantitative analytic styles, since the formalism can be interpreted with and without numbers. The formalism is applied to key concepts in argumentative, scenario and probabilistic analyses of evidential reasoning, and is illustrated with a fictional crime investigation example based on Alfred Hitchcock's film `To Catch A Thief'.

We describe a legal case processing model based on the transformation of relevant data from a legal case file by a judge, to produce what we call the judge's perception of the case. That is a representation of the case that stresses (1) the relevance of the different attributes of the case, and (2) the relationships among attributes that the judge considers relevant for argumentation purposes.

AB  - Modelling argumentation based on legal cases has been a central topic of AI and Law since its very beginnings. The current established view is that facts must be determined on the basis of evidence. Next, these facts must be used to ascribe legally significant predicates (factors and issues) to the case, on the basis of which the outcome can be established. This thesis aims to provide a method to encapsulate the knowledge of bodies of case law from various legal domains using a recent development in AI knowledge representation, Abstract Dialectical Frameworks (ADFs), as the central feature of the design method. Three legal domains in the US Courts are used throughout the thesis: The domain of the Automobile Exception to the Fourth Amendment, which has been freshly analysed in terms of factors in this thesis; the US Trade Secrets domain analysed from well-known legal case-based reasoning systems (CATO and IBP); and the Wild Animals domain analysed extensively in AI and Law. In this work, ADFs play a role akin to that of Entity-Relationship models in the design of database systems to design and implement programs intended to decide cases, described as sets of factors, according to a theory of a particular domain based on a set of precedent cases relating to that domain. The ADFs in this thesis are instantiated from different starting points: factor-based representation of oral dialogues and factor-based analysis of legal opinions. A legal dialogue representation model is defined for the US Supreme Court Oral Hearing dialogues. The role of these hearings is to identify the components that can form the basis of an argument that will resolve the case. Dialogue moves used by participants have been identified as the dialogue proceeds to assert and modify argument components in term of issues, factors and facts, and to produce what are called Argument Component Trees (ACTs) for each participant in the dialogue, showing how these components relate to one another. The resulting trees can be then merged and used as input to decide the accepted components using an ADF. The model is illustrated using two landmark case studies in the Automobile Exception domain: Carney v. California and US v. Chadwick. A legal justification model is defined to capture knowledge in a legal domain and to provide justification and transparency of legal decisions. First, a legal domain ADF is instantiated from the factor hierarchy of CATO and IBP, then the method is applied to the other two legal domains. In each domain, the cases are expressed in terms of factors organised into an ADF, from which an executable program can be implemented in a straightforward way by taking advantage of the closeness of the acceptance conditions of the ADF to components of an executable program. The proposed method is evaluated to test the ease of implementation, the efficacy of the resulting program, the ease of refinement, transparency of the reasoning and transferability across legal domains. This evaluation suggests ways of improving the decision by incorporating the case facts, and considering justification and reasoning using portions of precedents. The final result is ANGELIC (ADF for kNowledGe Encapsulation of Legal Information from Cases), a method for producing programs that decide the cases with a high degree of accuracy in multiple domains.

AB  - The two main types of law are legislation and precedents. Both types have a corresponding reasoning pattern determining legal consequences: legislation can be applied and precedents followed. The separate modelling of these two reasoning patterns using logical techniques has recently seen considerable progress. About the logical links between the two less is known, although progress has already been made. This document focuses on such logical relations. The main question is: to what extent can the application of legislation and precedent adherence be considered as two sides of the same logical coin? Findings from the boundaries of logic and law will serve as a starting point. This text is a translated, adapted and extended version of Verheij 2007.

AB  - Texts expressed in legal language are often difficult and time consuming for lawyers to read through, particularly for the purpose of identifying relevant deontic modalities (obligations, prohibitions and permissions). By nature, the language of law is strict, hence the predominant use of modal logic as a substitute for the syntactical ambiguity in natural language, specifically, deontic and alethic logic for the respective modalities. However, deontic modalities which express obligations, prohibitions and permissions, can have varying degree and preciseness to which they correspond to a matter, strict deontic logic does not allow for such quantitative measures. Therefore, this paper outlines a data-driven approach by classifying deontic modalities using ensembled Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) that incorporate domain specific legal distributional semantic model (DSM) representations, in combination with, a general DSM representation. We propose to use well calibrated probability estimates from these classifiers as an approximation to the degree which an obligation/prohibition or permission belongs to a given class based on SME annotated sentences. Best results show 82.33 % accuracy on a held-out test set.

AB  - Service contracts bind parties legally, regulating their behavior in the scope of a (business) service relationship. Given that there are legal consequences attached to service contracts, understanding the elements of a contract is key to managing services in an enterprise. After all, provisions in a service contract establish obligations and rights for service providers and customers that must be respected in service delivery. The importance of service contracts to service provisioning in an enterprise has motivated us to investigate their representation in enterprise models. We have observed that approaches fall into two extremes of a spectrum. Some approaches, such as ArchiMate, offer an opaque "contract" construct, not revealing the rights and obligations in the scope of the governed service relationship. Other approaches, under the umbrella term "contract languages", are devoted exactly to the formal representation of the contents of contracts. Despite the applications of contract languages, they operate at a level of detail that does not match that of enterprise architecture models. In this paper, we explore the gap between these two extremes. We address the representation of service contract elements with a systematic approach: we first propose a well-founded service contract ontology, and then extend the ArchiMate language to reflect the elements of the service contract ontology. The applicability of the proposed extension is assessed in the representation of a real-world cloud service contract.

AB  - This paper gives an account of dimensions in the reason model found in Horty (Legal Theory 17(1): 1–33, 2011), Horty and Bench-Capon (in: Proceedings of the 15th international conference on artificial intelligence and law, pp 109–118, ACM Press, 2012) and Rigoni (Artif Intell Law 23(2):133–160, 2015. doi: 10.1007/s10506-015-9166-x). The account is constructed with the purpose of rectifying problems with the approach to incorporating dimensions in Horty (2017), namely, the problems arising from the collapse of the distinction between the reason model and the result model on that approach. Examination of the newly constructed theory revealed that the importance of dimensions in the reason model lies in their ability to establish weighings between reasons/factors of the same polarity. This permits past cases to constrain future cases in ways they could not on the reason model with just factors. The paper then discusses how dimensions might be established from a case base and how dimensions that are incomplete in various aspects might be dealt with in the theory. It closes with comparisons to other work in the literature on AI and Law and suggestions for further improvement of the reason model.

AB  - Scenario Analytics is a type of analysis that focuses on the evaluation of different scenarios, their merits and their consequences. In the context of the legal domain, this could be in the form of analyzing large databases of legal cases, their facts and their claims, to answer questions such as: Do the current facts warrant litigation?, Is the litigation best pursued before a judge or a jury?, How long is it likely to take?, and What are the best strategies to use for achieving the most favorable outcome for the client? In this work, we report on research directed at answering such questions. We use one of a set of jury verdicts databases totaling nearly a half-million records. At the same time, we conduct a series of experiments that answer key questions and build, sequentially, a powerful data-driven legal decision support system, one that can assist an attorney to differentiate more effective from less effective legal principles and strategies. Ultimately, it represents a productivity tool that can help a litigation attorney make the most prudent decisions for his or her client.

AB  - This paper presents the Value Judgment Formalism and its experimental implementation in the VJAP system, which is capable of arguing about, and predicting outcomes of, a set of trade secret misappropriation cases. VJAP creates an argument graph for each case using argument schemes and a representation of values underlying trade secret law and effects of facts on these values. It balances effects on values in each case and analogizes it to tradeoffs in precedents. It predicts case outcomes using a confidence measure computed from the graph and generates textual legal arguments justifying its predictions. The confidence propagation uses quantitative weights learned from past cases using an iterative optimization method. Prediction performance on a limited dataset is competitive with common machine learning models. The results and VJAP's behavior are discussed in detail.

AB  - The effectiveness of document Information Extraction (IE) is greatly affected by the structure and layout of the documents being considered. In the case of legal documents relating to commercial law, an additional challenge is the many different and varied formats, structures and layouts used. In this paper, we present work on a flexible and scalable IE environment, the CLIEL (Commercial Law Information Extraction based on Layout) environment, for application to commercial law documentation that allows layout rules to be derived and then utilised to support IE. The proposed CLIEL environment operates using NLP (Natural Language Processing) techniques, JAPE (Java Annotation Patterns Engine) rules and some GATE (General Architecture for Text Engineering) modules. The system is fully described and evaluated using a commercial law document corpus. The results demonstrate that considering the layout is beneficial for extracting data point instances from legal document collections.

We provide a labeled dataset with gold contract element annotations, along with an unlabeled dataset of contracts that can be used to pre-train word embeddings. Both datasets are provided in an encoded form to bypass privacy issues. We describe and experimentally compare several contract element extraction methods that use manually written rules and linear classifiers (logistic regression, SVMs) with hand-crafted features, word embeddings, and part-of-speech tag embeddings. The best results are obtained by a hybrid method that combines machine learning (with hand-crafted features and embeddings) and manually written post-processing rules.

The usefulness of several recognised argument schemes is confirmed, two new schemes for interpretation arguments and for arguments from statistics are proposed, and an analysis is given of debates about the validity of arguments. From a practical point of view the case study yields insights into the design of support software for discussions about Bayesian modellings of complex criminal cases.

These enable propositional reasoning, but sometimes a balance between dimensions needs to be struck, and to permit trade offs we need to keep the magnitudes and so reason more geometrically. We discuss dimensions and values, arguing that values can play several distinct roles, both explaining preferences between factors and indicating the purposes of the law.

AB  - Literature on business process compliance (BPC) has predominantly focused on the alignment of the regulatory rules with the design, verification and validation of business processes. Previously, surveys on BPC have been conducted with specific context in mind; however, the literature on BPC management research is largely sparse and does not accumulate a detailed understanding on existing literature and related issues faced by the domain. This survey provides a holistic view of the literature on existing BPC management approaches and categorises them based on different compliance management strategies in the context of formulated research questions. A systematic literature approach is used where search terms pertaining keywords were used to identify literature related to the research questions from scholarly databases. From initially 183 papers, we selected 79 papers related to the themes of this survey published between 2000 and 2015. The survey results reveal that mostly compliance management approaches centre around three distinct categories, namely design-time (\(28\%\)), run-time (\(32\%\)) and auditing (\(10\%\)). Also, organisational and internal control-based compliance management frameworks (\(21\%\)) and hybrid approaches make (\(9\%\)) of the surveyed approaches. Furthermore, open research challenges and gaps are identified and discussed with respect to the compliance problem.

AB  - Software analytics has been the subject of considerable recent attention but is yet to receive significant industry traction. One of the key reasons is that software practitioners are reluctant to trust predictions produced by the analytics machinery without understanding the rationale for those predictions. While complex models such as deep learning and ensemble methods improve predictive performance, they have limited explainability. In this paper, we argue that making software analytics models explainable to software practitioners is as \emph{important} as achieving accurate predictions. Explainability should therefore be a key measure for evaluating software analytics models. We envision that explainability will be a key driver for developing software analytics models that are useful in practice. We outline a research roadmap for this space, building on social science, explainable artificial intelligence and software engineering.

AB  - Advances in artificial intelligence, sensors and big data management have far-reaching societal impacts. As these systems augment our everyday lives, it becomes increasing-ly important for people to understand them and remain in control. We investigate how HCI researchers can help to develop accountable systems by performing a literature analysis of 289 core papers on explanations and explaina-ble systems, as well as 12,412 citing papers. Using topic modeling, co-occurrence and network analysis, we mapped the research space from diverse domains, such as algorith-mic accountability, interpretable machine learning, context-awareness, cognitive psychology, and software learnability. We reveal fading and burgeoning trends in explainable systems, and identify domains that are closely connected or mostly isolated. The time is ripe for the HCI community to ensure that the powerful new autonomous systems have intelligible interfaces built-in. From our results, we propose several implications and directions for future research to-wards this goal.

AB  - We present and formalize the due diligence problem, where lawyers extract data from legal documents to assess risk in a potential merger or acquisition, as an information retrieval task. Furthermore, we describe the creation and annotation of a document collection for the due diligence problem that will foster research in this area. This dataset comprises 50 topics over 4,412 documents and ~15 million sentences and is a subset of our own internal training data. Using this dataset, we present what we have found to be the state of the art for information extraction in the due diligence problem. In particular, we find that when treating documents as sequences of labelled and unlabelled sentences, Conditional Random Fields significantly and substantially outperform other techniques for sequence-based (Hidden Markov Models) and non-sequence based machine learning (logistic regression). Included in this is an analysis of what we perceive to be the major failure cases when extraction is performed based upon sentence labels.

AB  - Much research is ongoing to assess and improve compliance to laws and regulations. As this domain continues to grow and mature, and with more modelling methods introduced to support compliance tasks, important questions need to be asked. What exactly are these methods used for? Where have they been applied? What benefits do they offer? This paper explores how goal-oriented and non-goal-oriented modelling methods have been used for legal and regulatory compliance, and identifies their main claimed benefits and drawbacks based on the kind of compliance tasks they perform. Using a systematic literature mapping approach, we evaluated 103 articles describing the use of modelling methods obtained from a pool of 286 articles. The results indicate that modelling methods focus on the intent of a law, but goal-oriented modelling methods do so while also reflecting the structure of a law, generally with substantial benefits for all compliance tasks. In addition, whereas modelling methods are used for compliance modelling, checking, analysis and enactment tasks, our analysis indicates that the coverage of these methods is more frequent in the healthcare domain with 55% of the articles reviewed targeting it. In terms of the contexts modelling methods address, privacy has the highest level of attention with a focus from 54% of the reviewed articles. The articles reviewed revealed a total of 60 different laws and regulations from 14 different countries, with 62% focusing on privacy. Moreover, while 82% of the articles reviewed addressed concerns of regulated parties, only 12% addressed the concerns of regulators, and 6% addressed concerns of both regulating and regulated parties. This study highlights the benefits and drawbacks of both types ofmodelling methods and identifies potential benefits and common drawbacks that will be of interest to researchers and practitioners in the selection of modelling methods or in the identification of selection criteria. Finally, the mapping results emphasize the need for more studies outside of healthcare, that are related to contexts other than privacy, that target compliance enactment tasks or that take the concerns of regulators into consideration.

AB  - The smart contract is an interdisciplinary concept that concerns business, finance, contract law and information technology. Designing and developing a smart contract may require the close cooperation of many experts coming from different fields. How to support such collaborative development is a challenging problem in blockchain-oriented software engineering. This paper proposes SPESC, a specification language for smart contracts, which can define the specification of a smart contract for the purpose of collaborative design. SPESC can specify a smart contract in a similar form to real-world contracts using a natural-language-like grammar, in which the obligations and rights of parties and the transaction rules of cryptocurrencies are clearly defined. The preliminary study results demonstrated that SPESC can be easily learned and understood by both IT and non-IT users and thus has greater potential to facilitate collaborative smart contract development.

Thus, BPC is an essential part of both business process management (BPM) and compliance management (CM). Digitization has also been referred to as a “digital revolution” that describes a technological change that has extended to many organizational areas and tasks, including compliance. Current efforts to digitize, e.g., by realizing cyber-physical systems, rely on the automation and interoperability of systems. In order for CM not to hamper these efforts, it becomes an increasingly relevant issue to digitize compliance as well.

We advocate that the level of abstraction, which can be flexibly adjusted, is conveniently realized through Granular Computing. Granular Computing is concerned with the development and processing information granules – formal entities which facilitate a way of organizing knowledge about the available data and relationships existing there. This study identifies the principles of Granular Computing, shows how information granules are constructed and subsequently used in describing relationships present among the data.

AB  - Technology is starting to play a key role in cities’ urban sustainability plans. This is because new technologies can provide them with robust solutions that are of benefit to citizens. Cities aim to incorporate smart systems in their industrial, infrastructural, educational, and social activities. A Smart City is managed with intelligent technologies which allow improving the quality of the services offered to citizens and make all processes more efficient. However, the Smart City concept is fairly recent. The ideas that it encompasses have not yet been consolidated due to the large number of fields and technologies that fit under this concept. All of this led to confusion about the definition of a Smart City and this is evident in the literature. This article explores the literature that addresses the topic of Smart Cities; a comprehensive analysis of the concept and existing platforms is performed. We gain a clear understanding of the services that a Smart City must provide, the technology it should employ for the development of these services, and the scope that this concept covers. Moreover, the shortcomings and needs of Smart Cities are identified and a model for designing a Smart City architecture is proposed. In addition, three case studies have been proposed: the first is a simulator to study the implementation of various services and technologies, the second case study to manage incidents that occur in a Smart City, and the third case study to monitor the deployment of large-scale sensors in a Smart City.

AB  - Growing interest in eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to make AI and machine learning more understandable to human users. However, most existing work focuses on new algorithms, and not on usability, practical interpretability and efficacy on real users. In this vision paper, we propose a new research area of eXplainable AI for Designers (XAID), specifically for game designers. By focusing on a specific user group, their needs and tasks, we propose a human-centered approach for facilitating game designers to co-create with AI/ML techniques through XAID. We illustrate our initial XAID framework through three use cases, which require an understanding both of the innate properties of the AI techniques and users’ needs, and we identify key open challenges.

Finally we identify the additional value related information required to produce a working program: thresholds and weights as well as a simple preference ordering.

AB  - Programs, like people, get old. We can't prevent aging, but we can understand its causes, take steps to limits its effects, temporarily reverse some of the damage it has caused, and prepare for the day when the software is no longer viable. A sign that the software engineering profession has matured will be that we lose our preoccupation with the first release and focus on the long-term health of our products. Researchers and practitioners must change their perception of the problems of software development. Only then will software engineering deserve to be called "engineering". >

AB  - Argumentation mining aims to automatically detect, classify and structure argumentation in text. Therefore, argumentation mining is an important part of a complete argumentation analyisis, i.e. understanding the content of serial arguments, their linguistic structure, the relationship between the preceding and following arguments, recognizing the underlying conceptual beliefs, and understanding within the comprehensive coherence of the specific topic. We present different methods to aid argumentation mining, starting with plain argumentation detection and moving forward to a more structural analysis of the detected argumentation. Different state-of-the-art techniques on machine learning and context free grammars are applied to solve the challenges of argumentation mining. We also highlight fundamental questions found during our research and analyse different issues for future research on argumentation mining.

AB  - The automatic extraction of information from unstructured sources has opened up new avenues for querying, organizing, and analyzing data by drawing upon the clean semantics of structured databases and the abundance of unstructured data. The field of information extraction has its genesis in the natural language processing community where the primary impetus came from competitions centered around the recognition of named entities like people names and organization from news articles. As society became more data oriented with easy online access to both structured and unstructured data, new applications of structure extraction came around. Now, there is interest in converting our personal desktops to structured databases, the knowledge in scientific publications to structured records, and harnessing the Internet for structured fact finding queries. Consequently, there are many different communities of researchers bringing in techniques from machine learning, databases, information retrieval, and computational linguistics for various aspects of the information extraction problem.

This review is a survey of information extraction research of over two decades from these diverse communities. We create a taxonomy of the field along various dimensions derived from the nature of the extraction task, the techniques used for extraction, the variety of input resources exploited, and the type of output produced. We elaborate on rule-based and statistical methods for entity and relationship extraction. In each case we highlight the different kinds of models for capturing the diversity of clues driving the recognition process and the algorithms for training and efficiently deploying the models. We survey techniques for optimizing the various steps in an information extraction pipeline, adapting to dynamic data, integrating with existing entities and handling uncertainty in the extraction process.

AB  - The third of Berman and Hafner's early nineties papers on reasoning with legal cases concerned temporal context, in particular the evolution of case law doctrine over time in response to new cases and against a changing background of social values and purposes. In this paper we consider the ways in which changes in case law doctrine can be accommodated in a recently proposed methodology for encapsulating case law theories (the ANGELIC methodology based on Abstract Dialectical Frameworks), and relate these changes the sources of change identified by Berman and Hafner.

AB  - In this paper we explore the thesis that the role of argumentation in practical reasoning in general and legal reasoning in particular is to justify the use of defeasible rules to derive a conclusion in preference to the use of other defeasible rules to derive a conflicting conclusion. The defeasibility of rules is expressed by means of non-provability claims as additional conditions of the rules.

We outline an abstract approach to defeasible reasoning and argumentation which includes many existing formalisms, including default logic, extended logic programming, non-monotonic modal logic and auto-epistemic logic, as special cases. We show, in particular, that the `admissibility' semantics for all these formalisms has a natural argumentation-theoretic interpretation and proof procedure, which seem to correspond well with informal argumentation.

In the admissibility semantics there is only one way for one argument to attack another, namely by undermining one of its non-provability claims. In this paper, we show how other kinds of attack between arguments, specifically how rebuttal and priority attacks, can be reduced to the undermining of non-provability claims.

AB  - In an argumentation approach, legal evidential reasoning is modeled as the construction and attack of "trees of inference" from evidence to conclusions by applying generalizations to evidence or intermediate conclusions. In this paper, an argumentation-based analysis of the Simonshaven case is given in terms of a logical formalism for argumentation. The formalism combines abstract argumentation frameworks with accounts of the structure of arguments, of the ways they can be attacked and of ways to evaluate conflicting arguments. The purpose of this paper is not to demonstrate or argue that the argumentation approach to modeling legal evidential reasoning is feasible or even preferable but to have a fully worked-out example that can be used in the comparison with alternative Bayesian or scenario-based analyses.

AB  - This paper presents the hybrid theory of stories and arguments for reasoning with evidence in legal cases and applies this theory to the Simonshaven case. In the hybrid theory, alternative hypothetical stories about “what happened” in a case are constructed and discussed in a dialectical process of argument and counterargument. After informally explaining stories, arguments, and the ways in which they interact, this paper gives a method for rational proof based on critical questions and shows how this method can be used in the Simonshaven case.

This and the six working conferences that followed fostered the interaction of the dependability and security communities, and advanced the integration of security (confidentiality, integrity and availability) into the framework of dependable computing [22]. A summary of [22] is presented next. The concept of dependable computing first appears in the 1830’s in the context of Babbage’s Calculating Engine [1,2]. The first generation of electronic computers (late 1940’s to mid-50’s) used rather unreliable components, therefore practical techniques were employed to improve their reliability, such as error control codes, duplexing with comparison, triplication with voting, diagnostics to locate failed components, etc. [3-5]. 2.

AB  - Searching legal texts for relevant information is a complex and expensive activity. The search solutions offered by present-day legal portals are targeted primarily at legal professionals. These solutions are not adequate for requirements analysts whose objective is to extract domain knowledge including stakeholders, rights and duties, and business processes that are relevant to legal requirements. Semantic Web technologies now enable smart search capabilities and can be exploited to help requirements analysts in elaborating legal requirements. In our previous work, we developed an automated framework for extracting semantic metadata from legal texts. In this paper, we investigate the use of our metadata extraction framework as an enabler for smart legal search with a focus on requirements engineering activities. We report on our industrial experience helping the Government of Luxembourg provide an advanced search facility over Luxembourg's Income Tax Law. The experience shows that semantic legal metadata can be successfully exploited for answering requirements engineering-related legal queries. Our results also suggest that our conceptualization of semantic legal metadata can be further improved with new information elements and relations.

AB  - The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) harmonizes data privacy laws and regulations across Europe. Through the GDPR, individuals are able to better control their personal data in the face of new technological developments. While the GDPR is highly advantageous to individuals, complying with it poses major challenges for organizations that control or process personal data. Since no automated solution with broad industrial applicability currently exists for GDPR compliance checking, organizations have no choice but to perform costly manual audits to ensure compliance. In this paper, we share our experience building a UML representation of the GDPR as a first step towards the development of future automated methods for assessing compliance with the GDPR. Given that a concrete implementation of the GDPR is affected by the national laws of the EU member states, GDPR's expanding body of case law and other contextual information, we propose a two-tiered representation of the GDPR: a generic tier and a specialized tier. The generic tier captures the concepts and principles of the GDPR that apply to all contexts, whereas the specialized tier describes a specific tailoring of the generic tier to a given context, including the contextual variations that may impact the interpretation and application of the GDPR. We further present the challenges we faced in our modeling endeavor, the lessons we learned from it, and future directions for research.

AB  - Legal decision-support systems have the potential to improve access to justice, administrative efficiency, and judicial consistency, but broad adoption of such systems is contingent on development of technologies with low knowledge-engineering, validation, and maintenance costs. This paper describes two approaches to an important form of legal decision support---explainable outcome prediction---that obviate both annotation of an entire decision corpus and manual processing of new cases. The first approach, which uses an Attention Network for prediction and attention weights to highlight salient case text, was shown to be capable of predicting decisions, but attention-weight-based text highlighting did not demonstrably improve human decision speed or accuracy in an evaluation with 61 human subjects. The second approach, termed SCALE (Semi-supervised Case Annotation for Legal Explanations), exploits structural and semantic regularities in case corpora to identify textual patterns that have both predictable relationships to case decisions and explanatory value.

AB  - Software analytics has been the subject of considerable recent attention but is yet to receive significant industry traction. One of the key reasons is that software practitioners are reluctant to trust predictions produced by the analytics machinery without understanding the rationale for those predictions. While complex models such as deep learning and ensemble methods improve predictive performance, they have limited explainability. In this paper, we argue that making software analytics models explainable to software practitioners is as important as achieving accurate predictions. Explainability should therefore be a key measure for evaluating software analytics models. We envision that explainability will be a key driver for developing software analytics models that are useful in practice. We outline a research roadmap for this space, building on social science, explainable artificial intelligence and software engineering.

AB  - In this article we introduce a logical structure for normative reasoning, called Normative Detachment Structure with Ideal Conditions, that can be used to represent the content of certain legal texts in a normalized way. The structure exploits the deductive properties of a system of bimodal logic able to distinguish between ideal and actual normative statements, as well as a novel formalization of conditional normative statements able to capture interesting cases of contrary-to-duty reasoning and to avoid deontic paradoxes. Furthermore, we illustrate how the theoretical framework proposed can be mechanized to get an automated procedure of query-answering on an example of legal text.

AB  - Purpose: To determine the elicitation methodologies best placed to uncover and capture the expert operator’s reflective cognitive judgements in complex and dynamic military operating environments (e.g., explosive ordinance disposal) in order to develop the specification for a reflective eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) agent to support the training of domain novices. Approach: A bounded literature review of the latest developments in expert knowledge elicitation was undertaken to determine the ’art-of-the-possible’ in respects to uncovering an expert’s cognitive judgements in complex and dynamic environments. Candidate methodologies were systematically and critically reviewed in order to identify the most promising methodologies for uncovering expert situational awareness and metacognitive evaluations in pursuit of actionable threat mitigation strategies in high-risk contexts. Research outputs are synthesized into an interview protocol for eliciting and understanding the in-situ actions and decisions of experts in high-risk, complex operating environments. Practical implications: Trainees entering high-risk operating environments can benefit from exposure to expert reflective strategies whilst learning the trade. Typical operator training focuses on technical aspects of threat mitigation but often overlooks reflective self-evaluation. The present study represents an initial step towards determining the feasibility of designing a reflective XAI agent to augment the performance of trainees entering high-risk operations. Outputs of the expert knowledge elicitation protocol documented here shall be used to refine a theoretical framework of expert operator judgement, in order to determine decision support strategies of benefit to domain novices.

However, AI is also about other areas, such as Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, or Distributed AI, i.e., areas that need to be combined to reach the level of intelligence initially envisioned in the 1950s. Explainable AI (XAI) now refers to the core backup for industry to apply AI in products at scale, particularly for industries operating with critical systems. This paper reviews XAI not only from a Machine Learning perspective, but also from the other AI research areas, such as AI Planning or Constraint Satisfaction and Search. We expose the XAI challenges of AI fields, their existing approaches, limitations and opportunities for Knowledge Graphs and their underlying technologies.

AB  - Trusted medical software devices, must comply with one of the healthcare regulations such as Food and Drug Administration (FDA), EU Medical Device Regulation (MDR), and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Since these regulations are enacted by law legislators and written in a legal text, these regulations are typically written with ambiguities. However, people have a different interpretation for the legal text for example, software developers faced challenges in identifying and understanding the regulatory requirements that are related to the software development process. Moreover, ambiguous in regulatory requirements play a big role in software compliance with regulatory particularly, when the requirements are legal text.   In this paper, we intend to minimize the ambiguities in EU MDR requirements based on requirement engineering techniques in order to make MDR requirements clear and precise for software developers. In our previous work, we extracted the requirements of MDR that would affect the software development life cycle (SDLC) directly or indirectly. Herein, we will identify the ambiguity types in the extracted requirements of MDR. Moreover, this paper will present a method to minimize the ambiguities in MDR requirements based on requirement engineering techniques (user story and use case diagram). Finally, this work will be evaluated by the critical-to-quality tree measurement technique.

AB  - [Context and motivation] Legal provisions create a distinct set of requirements for businesses to be compliant with. Capturing legal requirements and managing regulatory compliance is a challenging task in system development. [Question/problem] Part of this task involves modeling legal requirements, which is not trivial for requirements engineers as non-experts in law. The resultant legal requirements models also tend to be very complex and hard to understand. [Principal ideas/results] To facilitate the modeling process, we propose a formal framework for modeling legal requirements. This framework includes a methodology that helps to resolve complexities of legal requirements models. [Contribution] In this paper, we outline this methodology and present a procedure that reduces modal and conditional complexities of legal models and facilitates automation of the modeling process.

AB  - Legal web information retrieval systems need the capability to reason with the knowledge modeled by legal ontologies. Using this knowledge it is possible to represent and to make inferences about the semantic content of legal documents.

In this paper a methodology for applying NLP techniques to automatically create a legal ontology is proposed. The ontology is defined in the OWL semantic web language and it is used in a logic programming framework, EVOLP+ISCO, to allow users to query the semantic content of the documents. ISCO allows an easy and efficient integration of declarative, object-oriented and constraint-based programming techniques with the capability to create connections with external databases. EVOLP is a dynamic logic programming framework allowing the definition of rules for actions and events.

An application of the proposed methodology to the legal information retrieval system of the Portuguese Attorney General's Office is described.

AB  - Legal contracts specify the terms and conditions (in essence, requirements) that apply to business transactions. Smart contracts are software systems that monitor and control the execution of contracts to ensure compliance. This paper proposes a formal specification language for contracts, called Symboleo, where contracts consist of collections of obligations and powers that define the legal contract’s compliant executions. The formal semantics of Symboleo is based on an extension of an ontology for Law and is described in terms of logical axioms on statecharts that describe the lifetimes of contracts, obligations and powers. Our proposal includes a preliminary evaluation through the specification of a real life-inspired Sale-of-Goods contract, with a prototype execution engine. We envision this language to enable formally verifying contracts to detect requirements-level issues and to generate executable smart contracts (e.g., on blockchain technology).

AB  - [Context] In legal requirements elicitation, requirements analysts need to extract obligations from legal texts. However, legal texts often express obligations only indirectly, for example, by attributing a right to the counterpart. This phenomenon has already been described in the Requirements Engineering (RE) literature [1]. [Objectives] We investigate the use of requirements templates for the systematic elicitation of legal requirements. Our work is motivated by two observations: (1) The existing literature does not provide a harmonized view on the requirements templates that are useful for legal RE; (2) Despite the promising recent advancements in natural language processing (NLP), automated support for legal RE through the suggestion of requirements templates has not been achieved yet. Our objective is to take steps toward addressing these limitations. [Methods] We review and reconcile the legal requirement templates proposed in RE. Subsequently, we conduct a qualitative study to define NLP rules for template recommendation. [Results and Conclusions] Our contributions consist of (a) a harmonized list of requirements templates pertinent to legal RE, and (b) rules for the automatic recommendation of such templates. We evaluate our rules through a case study on 400 statements from two legal domains. The results indicate a recall and precision of 82,3% and 79,8%, respectively. We show that introducing some limited interaction with the analyst considerably improves accuracy. Specifically, our human-feedback strategy increases recall by 12% and precision by 10,8%, thus yielding an overall recall of 94,3% and overall precision of 90,6%.

AB  - In this paper, we present our work on extracting and classifying requirements from large software engineering contracts. Typically, the process of requirements elicitation begins after a contractual agreement is signed by all participants. Our interactions with the legal compliance team in a large vendor organization reveal that business contracts can help in the identification of high-level requirements relevant to the success of software engineering projects. We posit that requirements engineering as a discipline has an even wider scope than software engineering of which it is traditionally considered to be a sub-discipline. This is because software engineering-specific requirements are but a part of the success story of any large project. The requirements that emerge from contracts are obligatory in nature, whether or not they pertain to core software development. Therefore, it is important that these are extracted and classified for the benefit of software engineers and other stakeholders responsible for a project. We discuss the results of an exploratory study and a range of experiments from the use of regular expressions to Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for automating the extraction and classification of requirements from software engineering contracts. With Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, we obtained a high f-score of greater than eighty four percent for classification of requirements.

AB  - AbstractLegal contracts specify obligations and powers among legal subjects, involve assets, and are subject to quality constraints. Smart contracts are software systems that monitor the execution of contracts to ensure compliance. As a starting point for developing software engineering concepts, tools, and techniques for smart contracts, we have proposed Symboleo, a formal specification language for contracts. The complexity of real-life contracts (e.g., in the construction and transportation industries) requires specification languages to support execution-time operations for contracts, such as subcontracting, assignment, delegation, and substitution. This paper formalizes such concepts by proposing for them a syntax and axiomatic semantics within Symboleo. This formalization makes use of primitive operations that support the transfer or sharing of right, responsibility, and performance among contracting and subcontracting parties. A prototype compliance checking tool for Symboleo has also been created to support monitoring compliance for contracts that include subcontracting aspects. A realistic freight contract specified in Symboleo is provided as an illustrative example for our proposal, and is used for a preliminary evaluation with positive results.KeywordsContractsFormal specification languagesLegal subcontractsSmart contractsSubcontracting

In particular we use the contract language CL as a target formal language for this translation. In our framework CL specifications could then be input into the tool CLAN to detect the presence of conflicts (whether there are contradictory obligations, permissions, and prohibitions. We also use GF to get a version in (restricted) English of CL formulae. We discuss the implementation of such a framework.

The logic extends the system of Prakken (2001), which in turn modified the system of Prakken & Sartor (1996) with the possibility to distribute the burden of proof over both sides in an argument game. First the (2001) system is put in the context of a distinction of three types of proof burdens and it is argued that the proof burdens of that system are in fact burdens of persuasion. Then the (2001) system is modified to allow for defeasible reasoning about allocations of such burdens within the logic. The usefulness of the resulting system is illustrated with applications to real legal cases.

AB  - SweetDeal is a rule-based approach to representation of business contracts that enables software agents to create, evaluate, negotiate, and execute contracts with substantial automation and modularity. It builds upon the situated courteous logic programs knowledge representation in RuleML, the emerging standard for Semantic Web XML rules. Here, we newly extend the SweetDeal approach by also incorporating process knowledge descriptions whose ontologies are represented in DAML+OIL (the close predecessor of W3C's OWL, the emerging standard for Semantic Web ontologies), thereby enabling more complex contracts with behavioral provisions, especially for handling exception conditions (e.g., late delivery or non-payment) that might arise during the execution of the contract. This provides a foundation for representing and automating deals about services - in particular, about Web Services, so as to help search, select, and compose them. We give a detailed application scenario of late delivery in manufacturing supply chain management (SCM). In doing so, we draw upon our new formalization of process ontology knowledge from the MIT Process Handbook, a large, previously-existing repository used by practical industrial process designers. Our system is the first to combine emerging Semantic Web standards for knowledge representation of rules (RuleML) with ontologies (DAML+OIL/OWL) with each other, and moreover for a practical e-business application domain, and further to do so with process knowledge. This also newly fleshes out the evolving concept of Semantic Web Services. A prototype (soon public) is running. e-business, information technologies

AB  - After years of Congressional debates and agency rule-making, the HIPAA health care privacy rule has finally become effective. Why did it take so long? Many of the issues which deadlocked Congressional attempts to pass federal privacy legislation reflect deep disagreements over how much individual privacy should be protected. On one hand, patients often believe that no one except their closest health caregivers should be able to see their medical records without their permission. On the other hand, many other people and entities, mostly strangers to the patient, believe they should have access to those records without having to ask permission. They argue that such relatively free access to individual health care information is good for the patient, good for other patients, and good for society - in other words, that too much privacy protection is bad for our individual and collective health. Indeed, society has often tolerated sacrifices in individual medical privacy in order to promote the public good. This article examines the ethical trade-offs that we have made between the benefits of privacy protection and the benefits of sacrificing it in the name of social welfare, such as advances in scientific research, protection of the public health, higher efficiency and better quality in the delivery of health care, and even improved law enforcement. It analyzes how these ethical trade-offs have been reflected in our laws, Congressional debates, and recent HIPAA privacy rule. It also examines several key issues which created the impasse in enacting comprehensive federal legislation, and which continue to be controversial as providers face the task of compliance. The article serves as a guide for legal and health care professionals who would like to be introduced to what the controversy over health care privacy has been all about and how the HIPAA rule has, at least for the time being, resolved some aspects of it.

AB  - The two different categories of legal AI system are described, and legal analysis systems are chosen as objects of study. So-called judgment machines are discussed, but it is decided that research in legal AI systems would be best carried-out in the area of legal expert systems. A model of legal reasoning is adopted, and two different methods of legal knowledge representation are examined: rule-based systems and case-based systems. It is argued that a rule-based approach to legal expert systems is inadequate given the requirements of lawyers and the nature of legal reasoning about cases. A new, eclectic approach is proposed, incorporating both rule-based and case-based knowledge representation. It is claimed that such an approach can form the basis of an effective and useful legal expert system.

Presumptions are modelled as default rules and their effect on the burden of proof is defined in terms of a distinction between the burden of production, the burden of persuasion and the tactical burden of proof. These notions are logically characterised in such a way that presumptions enable a party to fulfil a burden of production or persuasion while shifting a tactical burden to the other party. Finally, it is shown how debates about what can be presumed can be modelled as debates about the backings of default rules.

AB  - Abstract   This article studies optimal fines when an offender's wealth is private information that can be obtained by the enforcement authority only after a costly audit. I derive the optimal fine for the underlying offense, the optimal fine for misrepresenting one's wealth level, and the optimal audit probability. The optimal fine for misrepresenting wealth equals the fine for the offense divided by the audit probability, and therefore generally exceeds the fine for the offense. The optimal audit probability is positive, increases as the cost of an audit declines, and equals unity if the cost is sufficiently low. If the optimal audit probability is less than unity, there are some individuals who are capable of paying the fine for the offense who misrepresent their wealth levels. Additionally, the optimal fine for the offense results in underdeterrence due to the cost of auditing wealth levels.

We argue that these differences largely are not a matter of logic but of legal policy, and we show how the various accounts can be logically formalised.

AB  - What strategies do lawyers and judges use to read the law? The study described in this article examined the way in which 10 legal experts (8 lawyers and 2 judges) and 10 novices (law students in the top 50% of their class) read a judicial opinion. Whereas the experts read efficiently (taking less overall time), the beginning law students read less efficiently. Where the experts read the text flexibly, moving back and forth between different parts of the opinion, the novices read inflexibly. The experts connected to the purpose of their reading more consistently than the novices and drew upon their prior knowledge and experience with the law. The results of this study suggest that we can give our students the following advice: (1) Read with a purpose; (2) Use background knowledge to situate the case; (3) Establish the context of the case before beginning to read; (4) Evaluate the case and have an opinion about its outcome; and (5) Read flexibly; skim and skip when appropriate. We can teach students the way in which a legal expert reads the law. The earlier they achieve these skills, the better for the individual students, the more likely their success in law school and the better for the legal profession as a whole.

Using concurrent stock returns of non-U.S.-traded foreign firms to estimate normal U.S. returns, I find that U.S. firms experienced a statistically significant negative cumulative abnormal return around key SOX events. I then examine the cross-sectional variation of U.S. firms’ returns around these events. Regression results are consistent with the non-audit services and governance provisions imposing net costs. Additional tests show that deferring the compliance of Section 404, which mandates an internal control test, resulted in significant cost savings for non-accelerated filers.

AB  - System behavior is often expressed by causal relations in requirements (e.g., If event 1, then event 2). Automatically extracting this embedded causal knowledge supports not only reasoning about requirements dependencies, but also various automated engineering tasks such as seamless derivation of test cases. However, causality extraction from natural language is still an open research challenge as existing approaches fail to extract causality with reasonable performance. We understand causality extraction from requirements as a two-step problem: First, we need to detect if requirements have causal properties or not. Second, we need to understand and extract their causal relations. At present, though, we lack knowledge about the form and complexity of causality in requirements, which is necessary to develop a suitable approach addressing these two problems. We conduct an exploratory case study with 14,983 sentences from 53 requirements documents originating from 18 different domains and shed light on the form and complexity of causality in requirements. Based on our findings, we develop a tool-supported approach for causality detection (CiRA). This constitutes a first step towards causality extraction from NL requirements. We report on a case study and the resulting tool-supported approach for causality detection in requirements. Our case study corroborates, among other things, that causality is, in fact, a widely used linguistic pattern to describe system behavior, as about a third of the analyzed sentences are causal. We further demonstrate that our tool CiRA achieves a macro-F1 score of 82 % on real word data and that it outperforms related approaches with an average gain of 11.06 % in macro-Recall and 11.43 % in macro-Precision. Finally, we disclose our open data sets as well as our tool to foster the discourse on the automatic detection of causality in the RE community.

AB  - Blockchain- and smart-contract technology enhance the effectiveness and automation of business processes. The rising interest in the development of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) shows that blockchain technology has the potential to reform business and society. A DAO is an organization wherein business rules are encoded in smart-contract programs that are executed when specified rules are met. The contractual- and business semantics are sine qua non for drafting a legally-binding smart contract in DAO collaborations. Several smart-contract languages (SCLs) exist, such as SPESC, or Symboleo to specify a legally-binding contract. However, their primary focus is on designing and developing smart contracts with the cooperation of IT- and non-IT users. Therefore, this paper fills a gap in the state of the art by specifying a smart-legal-contract markup language (SLCML) for legal- and business constructs to draft a legally-binding DAO. To achieve the paper objective, we first present a formal SCL ontology to describe the legal- and business semantics of a DAO. Secondly, we translate the SCL ontology into SLCML, for which we present the XML schema definition. We demonstrate and evaluate our SLCML language through the specification of a real life-inspired Sale-of-Goods contract. Finally, the SLCML use-case code is translated into Solidity to demonstrate its feasibility for blockchain platform implementations.

AB  - A fuzzy set is a class of objects with a continuum of grades of membership. Such a set is characterized by a membership (characteristic) function which assigns to each object a grade of membership ranging between zero and one. The notions of inclusion, union, intersection, complement, relation, convexity, etc., are extended to such sets, and various properties of these notions in the context of fuzzy sets are established. In particular, a separation theorem for convex fuzzy sets is proved without requiring that the fuzzy sets be disjoint.

This article introduces semantic network systems and their importance in Artificial Intelligence, followed by I. the early background; II. a summary of the basic ideas and issues including link types, frame systems, case relations, link valence, abstraction, inheritance hierarchies and logic extensions; and III. a survey of ‘world-structuring’ systems including ontologies, causal link models, continuous models, relevance, formal dictionaries, semantic primitives and intersecting inference hierarchies. Speed and practical implementation are briefly discussed. The conclusion argues for a synthesis of relational graph theory, graph-grammar theory and order theory based on semantic primitives and multiple intersecting inference hierarchies.

AB  - In this article, we propose a survey of the use of bipolarity in argumentation frameworks. On the one hand, the notion of bipolarity relies on the presence of two kinds of entities that have a diametrically opposed nature and that represent repellent forces (a positive entity and a negative entity). The notion exists in various domains (for example with the representation of preferences in artificial intelligence, or in cognitive psychology). On the other hand, argumentation process is a promising approach for reasoning, based on the construction and the comparison of arguments. It follows five steps: building the arguments, defining the interactions between these arguments, valuating the arguments, selecting the most acceptable arguments and, finally, drawing a conclusion. Using the nomenclature proposed by Dubois and Prade, this article shows on various applications, and with some formal definitions, that bipolarity appears in argumentation (in some cases if not always) and can be used in each step of this process under different forms. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract The military/aerospace industries have several decades of experience in the application of systems engineering. In the world of complex systems developed under contract, systems engineering has a well‐articulated, generally accepted, client‐mandated methodology. This is not the case currently in most commercially oriented research and development organizations. Unlike the military/aerospace environment, it is not widely accepted that systems engineering can or will deliver value within commercial enterprises. This said, it is possible that a systems engineering‐like methodology may be routinely employed but not so stated, or is recognized under a different label. This seems likely since complex products continue to be successfully developed and commercialized via the use of methods that are closely related to systems engineering. The purpose of this paper is to establish the groundwork for measuring the effectiveness of the systems engineering methodology, and closely associated analogs, as part of the product development process in a commercial research and development organization. In this paper, we review the literature in systems engineering and related fields to identify measurement issues and methodologies, specific metrics proposed and in use, and case studies and best practices. We also identify gaps in the literature and propose the next steps in a research agenda. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Syst Eng

AB  - The growth of electronic publication and informatics archives makes it possible to harvest vast quantities of knowledge about knowledge, or “metaknowledge.” We review the expanding scope of metaknowledge research, which uncovers regularities in scientific claims and infers the beliefs, preferences, research tools, and strategies behind those regularities. Metaknowledge research also investigates the effect of knowledge context on content. Teams and collaboration networks, institutional prestige, and new technologies all shape the substance and direction of research. We argue that as metaknowledge grows in breadth and quality, it will enable researchers to reshape science—to identify areas in need of reexamination, reweight former certainties, and point out new paths that cut across revealed assumptions, heuristics, and disciplinary boundaries.

AB  - This paper aims to advance the pedagogy of systems engineering by identifying opportunities and challenges in empirical research in the field. After an introduction to how empirical research could be further utilized in systems engineering, this paper discusses challenges faced when conducting empirical research in the field, threats to validity associated with systems engineering data collection, and considerations for empirical mixed-methods research. Two recently completed systems engineering empirical studies are used to illustrate specific examples. Finally, suggestions are given on how a professional society might provide additional support for researchers completing empirical research in systems engineering. The overarching goal of this paper is to describe how the increased use of empirical methods can be used to enrich the quality of research results which will in turn enhance the position of systems engineering as a widely recognized academic field. It is proposed that utilizing well-grounded, valid theory will improve understanding of systems engineering phenomena and advance the maturity of the field. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Syst Eng

AB  - In order to overcome current Internet limitations on overall network scalability and complexity, we introduce a new paradigm of semantic networking for the networks of the future, which brings together flow-based networking, traffic awareness, and self-management concepts to deliver plug-and-play networks. The natural traffic granularity is the flow between packet and circuit and between connection-less and connection-oriented modes. Using flow aggregation capabilities, we simplify traffic processing in the nodes through elastic fluid switching, and simplify traffic control through flow admission control, policing, and implicit quality of service (QoS) routing. By leveraging deep packet inspection and behavioral traffic analysis, network elements can autonomously and efficiently process the traffic flows they transport through real-time awareness gained via semantic analysis. The global consistency of node decisions within the whole network is ensured by self-management, applying the concepts of “knowledge plane” and “network mining.”

AB  - What philosophers call defeasible reasoning is roughly the same as nonmonotonic reasoning in AI. Some brief remarks are made about the nature of reasoning and the relationship between work in epistemology, AI, and cognitive psychology. This is followed by a general description of human rational architecture. This description has the consequence that defeasible reasoning has a more complicated structure than has generally been recognized in AI. We define a proposition to be warranted if it would be believed by an ideal reasoner. A general theory of warrant, based on defeasible reasons, is developed. This theory is then used as a guide in the construction of a theory of defeasible reasoning, and a computer program implementing that theory. The theory constructed deals with only a subset of defeasible reasoning, but it is an important subset.
