Ethical issues raised by LLMs and the need to align future versions makes it important to know how state of the art models reason about moral and legal issues. In this paper, we employ the methods of experimental psychology to probe into this question. We replicate eight studies from the experimental literature with instances of Google's Gemini Pro, Anthropic's Claude 2.1, OpenAI's GPT-4, and Meta's Llama 2 Chat 70b. We find that alignment with human responses shifts from one experiment to another, and that models differ amongst themselves as to their overall alignment, with GPT-4 taking a clear lead over all other models we tested. Nonetheless, even when LLM-generated responses are highly correlated to human responses, there are still systematic differences, with a tendency for models to exaggerate effects that are present among humans, in part by reducing variance. This recommends caution with regards to proposals of replacing human participants with current state-of-the-art LLMs in psychological research and highlights the need for further research about the distinctive aspects of machine psychology.","2024","2025-02-19 14:56:24","2025-02-19 14:56:24","","104145","","","333","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Large language models; AI Ethics; Ethics of artificial intelligence; Experimental jurisprudence; Machine Behavior; Machine psychology; Moral psychology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The game conflict is due to the trade-off in which firms are better-off when they pollute and are not inspected, while social welfare is maximized when auditors do not need to inspect socially responsible corporations that account for pollution in their production decisions regarding technology used and emission level. Starting with a well-mixed two-population game model, there is no long-run equilibrium and the shares of polluters and shirking auditors keep oscillating over time. In contrast, when firms and auditors are allocated in a spatial network, the game displays a rich dynamics depending on the inspecting cost. While the oscillatory behaviour is still possible, there is a set of parameters for which a long run robust equilibrium is achieved with the country leaving the pollution trap. On the other hand, an excessively high inspection cost leads to an ineffective auditing process that drives the few compliant firms out of the country.","2019","2025-02-19 14:56:24","2025-02-19 14:56:24","","486-501","","2","279","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Game theory; Agent-based model; Cellular automata; OR in Environment and climate change; Structured complex systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As the support of data security initiatives, data classification has received the bulk of attention and has been hailed by all walks of life. There is a lot of valuable information contained in the issued regulations, which has already been well exploited in the research of privacy policy compliance verification, whereas few scholars have drawn on such information to guide data classification for security and compliance. As a step towards this direction, in this paper, we define two information types: one is “regulated data” mentioned in external laws and regulations, another is “non-regulated data”, indicating internal business data produced in a certain organization, and develop a novel generalization-enhanced decision tree classification algorithm called Gen-DT to classify data. In this way, data covered by the relevant data security regulatory mandates can be quickly identified and handled in full compliance as well. Furthermore, we evaluate the proposed compliance-driven data classification scheme using datasets collected from two famous universities in China and validate that our approach can achieve better performance than existing popular machine learning techniques.","2023","2025-02-19 14:56:24","2025-02-19 14:56:24","","103240","","3","60","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Compliance; Data classification; Gen-DT; Non-regulated data; Regulated data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the era of cloud computing, this compliance management issue is exacerbated by the distributed nature of the system and by the limited control that customers have on the services. Today, the cloud industry is aware of this problem (as evidenced by the compliance program of many cloud service providers), and the research community is addressing the many facets of the legal-rule compliance checking and quality assurance problem. Cloud service brokerage plays an important role in legislation compliance and QoS management of cloud services. In this paper we discuss our experience in designing a legal-rule and QoS-aware cloud service broker, and we explore relate research issues. Specifically we provide three main contributions to the literature: first, we describe the detailed design architecture of the legal-rule and QoS-aware broker. Second, we discuss our design choices which rely on the state of the art solutions available in literature. We cover four main research areas: cloud broker service deployment, seamless cloud service migration, cloud service monitoring, and legal rule compliance checking.

Mathematical models are considered as tools to identify and to study decision making procedure from different aspects. In this paper, a mathematical model has been presented to show several factors can alter the output of decision making procedure before execution in a “Go/No-Go” task. The dynamic of this model has two stable fixed points, each of them corresponds to the “Press” and “Not-press” responses. This model that focuses on the fronto-striatal-thalamic direct and indirect pathways, receives planned decisions from frontal cortex and sends a regulated output to motor cortex for execution. The state-space analysis showed that several factors could affect the regulation procedure such as the input strength, noise value, initial condition, and the values of involved neurotransmitters. Some probable analytical reasons that may lead to changes in decision-execution regulation have been suggested as well. Bifurcation diagram analysis demonstrates that an optimal interaction between these factors can compensate the weaknesses of some others. It is predicted that abnormalities of response control in different brain disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder may be resolved by providing treatment techniques that target the regulation of the interaction. The model also suggests a possible justification to show why so many studies insist on the important role of dopamine in some brain disorders.","2017","2025-02-19 14:56:24","2025-02-19 14:56:24","","113-128","","","86","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Mathematical model; Decision execution; Executive system; Fronto-striatal-thalamic pathway; Go/No-Go; Phase- space","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing LJP methods primarily focus on improving representations of fact descriptions to enhance judgment performance. However, these methods typically depend on the superficial case information and neglect the underlying legal basis, resulting in a lack of in-depth reasoning and interpretability in the judgment process of long-tail or confusing cases. Recognizing that the basis for judgments in real-world legal contexts encompasses both factual logic and related legal knowledge, we introduce the interpretable legal judgment reasoning framework with multi-source knowledge prompted. The essence of this framework is to transform the implicit factual logic of cases and external legal knowledge into explicit basis for judgment, aiming to enhance not only the accuracy of judgment predictions but also the interpretability of the reasoning process. Specifically, we design a chain prompt reasoning module that guides a large language model to elucidate factual logic basis through incremental reasoning, aligning the model prior knowledge with task-oriented knowledge in the process. To match the above fact-based information with legal knowledge basis, we propose a contrastive knowledge fusing module to inject external statutes knowledge into the fact description embedding. It pushes away the distance of similar knowledge in the semantic space during the encoding of external knowledge base without manual annotation, thus improving the judgment prediction performance of long-tail and confusing cases. Experimental results on two real datasets indicate that our framework significantly outperforms existing LJP baseline methods in accuracy and interpretability, achieving new state-of-the-art performance. In addition, tests on specially constructed long-tail and confusing case datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework possesses improved generalization abilities for predicting these complex cases.","2025","2025-02-19 14:56:24","2025-02-19 14:56:24","","103996","","3","62","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Legal judgment prediction; Contrastive learning; Interpretability; Knowledge encoding; Prompt learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This includes the representation of deontic concepts, normative positions, legal ontologies, time and change. Then legal applications of logic are reviewed where legal rules are not just applied but are the object of reasoning and discourse. This includes arguing about applying statutory rules in unforeseen circumstances, interpretative reasoning in light of the facts of a case, and evidential reasoning to establish the facts of a case. This part of the review has special emphasis on argumentation-based approaches. This also holds for the final part, which discusses formal models of legal procedure and of multi-agent interaction in legal proceedings.

In 2004, the German Research Foundation (DFG) suggested a formula consisting of third-party funding, the cumulated JIF of publications and a fractional counting of publications to counteract the increasing inflation of author counts in medical publications. Whereas the third-party funding and the JIF are generally used in research evaluation without variation, the authorship regulation differs among medical faculties. We therefore compare medical faculties using the DFG model - to credit first and last authors with a higher share than middle authors - with those faculties that apply whole counting. We answer the question whether the faculties with the different counting methods also show different authorship and publication behaviour, i.e., authorship and collaboration patterns, the choice of journals (JIF level) and the citation impact (share of highly-cited papers). Findings indicate a clear trend of increasing co-author numbers and of middle-author papers, irrespective of authorship regulation. Publications with DFG model have only a slightly lower average author count and lower shares of middle-author papers than whole-counted publications. Our findings suggest that the DFG regulation has not resulted in a reduction of the number of authors, which was a major aim. Moreover, the results show that the use of whole counting goes together with higher productivity and higher impact, which may be a good reason to select that model.","2024","2025-02-19 14:56:24","2025-02-19 14:56:24","","101500","","2","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Author position; Citation impact; Co-authorship; Fractional counting; Performance-based funding; Research performance; Research policy; Whole counting","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) aims to reform the existing directive on the topic of personal data protection of EU citizens with a strong emphasis on more control of the citizens over their data and in the establishment of rules for the processing of personal data. OpenEHR is a standard that embodies many principles of interoperable and secure software for electronic health records (EHRs) and has been advocated as the best approach for the development of hospital information systems. Objective This study aimed to understand to what extent the openEHR standard can help in the compliance of EHR systems to the GDPR requirements. Methods A list of requirements for an EHR to support GDPR compliance and also a list of the openEHR design principles were made. The requirements were categorized and compared with the principles by experts on openEHR and GDPR. Results A total of 50 GDPR requirements and 8 openEHR design principles were identified. The openEHR principles conformed to 30% (15/50) of GDPR requirements. All the openEHR principles were aligned with GDPR requirements. Conclusions This study showed that the openEHR principles conform well to GDPR, underlining the common wisdom that truly realizing security and privacy requires it to be built in from the start. By using an openEHR-based EHR, the institutions are closer to becoming compliant with GDPR while safeguarding the medical data.","2019","2025-02-19 14:56:24","2025-02-19 14:56:24","","","","1","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GDPR; data protection; electronic health record; health information interoperability; openEHR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The regulatory compliance checking of underground utilities requires an objective and consistent interpretation of the regulations. However, utility regulations contain a variety of domain-specific terms and numerous spatial constraints regarding the location and clearance of underground utilities. It is challenging for the interpreters to understand both the domain and spatial semantics in utility regulations. To address the challenge, this paper adopts an ontology and rule-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) framework to automate the interpretation of utility regulations – the extraction of regulatory information and the subsequent transformation into logic clauses. Two new ontologies have been developed. The urban product ontology (UPO) is domain-specific to model domain concepts and capture domain semantics on top of heterogeneous terminologies in utility regulations. The spatial ontology (SO) consists of two layers of semantics – linguistic spatial expressions and formal spatial relations – for better understanding the spatial language in utility regulations. Pattern-matching rules defined on syntactic features (captured using common NLP techniques) and semantic features (captured using ontologies) were encoded for information extraction. The extracted information elements were then mapped to their semantic correspondences via ontologies and finally transformed into deontic logic (DL) clauses to achieve the semantic and logical formalization. The approach was tested on the spatial configuration-related requirements in utility accommodation policies. Results show it achieves a 98.2% precision and a 94.7% recall in information extraction, a 94.4% precision and a 90.1% recall in semantic formalization, and an 83% accuracy in logical formalization.","2021","2025-02-19 14:56:24","2025-02-19 14:56:24","","101288","","","48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Natural language processing; Ontology; Information extraction; Information formalization; Pattern-matching rules; Utility regulations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Based on an empirical engagement with the development of Cerberus – an advanced risk-based analytics platform aimed at the detection of previously ‘unknown’ threats – the article presents a dual argument. On the one hand, it provides an account of the remaining salience and extraterritorial reach of EU law in setting standards for the collection, retention, processing and sharing of Passenger Name Records (PNR) data in the UK. This PNR data is a constitutive component of the digital border. Through the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA), the UK is now bound to comply with the rather stringent legal safeguards developed by the CJEU (in Opinion 1/15) on the retention and automated processing of PNR data. Our analysis shows the different channels through which EU law obtains this extraterritorial reach, how compliance can be monitored and enforced, and, crucially, how it has influenced and constrained the technical design of the UK's digital borders – a salient and unexplored phenomenon that we describe as an Infrastructural Brussels Effect. Yet, on the other hand, the article empirically shows that this is not merely a process of norm diffusion and extraterritoriality. Once legal standards become infrastructurally embedded in Cerberus, we witness normative translations and sociotechnical shifts with important legal and political consequences. Legal standards on ‘reasonable suspicion’ and the ‘objective evidence’ of ‘risk’, we argue, are given specific meaning through a logic of relational inference and algorithmic pattern detection (leading to forms of ‘concern by association’). By studying the entanglements between legal norms and material infrastructures – an approach we describe as infra-legalities – these normative effects become visible and contestable, providing a productive site for the sociolegal study of law and algorithmic governance.","2024","2025-02-19 14:56:24","2025-02-19 14:56:24","","106057","","","55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","AI and algorithmic governance; Brussels Effect; Data Infrastructures; Digital borders; Infra-legalities; PNR data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The consequences of cyberbullying could be severe, especially on mental health, potentially leading to suicide in extreme cases. Although parents, schools and online social networking sites are encouraged to provide a safe online environment, little is known about the legal avenues which could be utilised to prevent cyberbullying or act as a deterrent. This article attempts to explore current laws, and the challenges that exist to establishing cyberbullying legislation in the context of the UK. It is arguable that a number of statutes may be of assistance in relation to cyberbullying, namely Education and Inspections Act 2006, Protection from Harassment Act 1997, Communications Act 2003, Malicious Communications Act 1988, Telecommunications Act 1984, Public Order Act 1986, Obscene Publications Act 1959, Computer Misuse Act 1990, Crime and Disorder Act 1998, and Defamation Act 2013. However, given the lack of clear definition of bullying, the applicability of these laws to cyberbullying is open to debate. Establishing new legislation or a modification to existing laws is particularly challenging for a number of reasons, namely: an absence of consistent bullying/cyberbullying definition, a difficulty in determining intention to harm or evidence of this, a lack of surveillance, a lack of general awareness, issues surrounding jurisdiction, the role of technology, and the age of criminal responsibility. These challenges are elaborated and discussed in this article.","2016","2025-02-19 14:56:25","2025-02-19 14:56:25","","127-141","","","65","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Children and adolescents; Cyberbullying; Cyberbullying prosecution; Legal challenges; Psychological impact; Victimisation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The European Union, United States, United Kingdom, and other countries and regions are gradually establishing risk-based, scenario-based, and outcome-based governance models for generative AI. China recently introduced new regulations for the management of generative AI, which adopt a governance model focusing on generative AI service providers. It suggests that China is continuing the principle of primary responsibility in Internet governance, which encompasses legal responsibility, contractual obligations, and ethical responsibility. However, the governance model based on primary responsibility emphasizes the accountability of generative AI model service providers, with relatively limited regulation on other important entities such as users and large-scale dissemination platforms, which may not be conducive to achieving China's regulatory goals for the AI industry. In comparison, the Meta-Regulation model could be an ideal alternative for China. As a classic theory explaining the public-private relationship, the ‘Meta-Regulation’ aligns with the generative AI governance requirements. Based on the Meta-Regulation theory, the governance of generative AI in China should move towards a direction of emphasizing safety, transparency, collaborative governance, and accountability. In line with this, it is necessary to include users and large-scale dissemination platforms within the regulatory scope and establish overarching governance objectives that ensure the responsible distribution of duties among stakeholders, with regulatory authorities assuming ultimate oversight responsibility and technical coordination. At the level of specific improvement measures, it is possible to integrate the three stages of model development, usage, and content dissemination of generative AI. During the model development stage, generative AI providers have specific transparency obligations. In the usage stage, a self-regulatory system centered around platform autonomy should be constructed. In the content dissemination stage, the proactive notification obligations of the dissemination platforms should be clearly defined. Additionally, the enforcement of technical interoperability requirements is necessary, thereby promoting the orderly development of generative AI applications.","2024","2025-02-19 14:56:25","2025-02-19 14:56:25","","106016","","","54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Generative AI; Collaborative governance; Meta-Regulation; Primary responsibility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Indeed, the modelling of the radio mobile channel small-scale fading is crucial in digital communications. It is the reason why several propagation models have been implemented to take into account the electromagnetic phenomena inherent in radio wave channels. Amongst these models is the family of statistical distributions which is rapid in computation time. In the context of this study our concern is to find, among different probability laws, the one which best coincides with radio channel behaviour.

Consumers have, perhaps inadvertently, flocked to the cloud via unpaid social media, storage and email offerings, whilst resisting paid cloud take-up for reasons (inter alia) of cost, resources, technical ignorance and security. Yet consumers are taking a storage, privacy and data risk in the ‘free’ cloud, and there is a growing consciousness of this fact. At present however, (non) buyer beware or “you get what you pay for” seems to be the prevailing industry – and consumer – expectation. The result is that individual and small business consumers are caught in a gap between paid and unpaid offerings; one which this paper explores through a consumer law view of cloud computing. An examination of Australian consumer law reveals that cloud provision is, like most other consumer ‘goods’ or ‘services’, covered under Australian law, and in particular, the laws governing false and misleading conduct, unconscionability, statutory guarantees and unfair contract terms. The paper considers these laws and industry regulatory solutions such as the New Zealand CloudCode, together with considering various cases brought to date, future developments and proposing future responses. The underlying prediction is that the emerging issue of consumer cloud integrity may present an impediment to wider individual/small business uptake, and that consumer law may emerge as an effective redress for this perceived market failure, and offer potentials to reshape the industry from a consumer perspective. The author concludes with the view that the cloud industry has significant risk assumption, contractual simplification and educative communication work yet to do to better encourage consumer paid cloud uptake and more universal adoption.","2015","2025-02-19 14:56:25","2025-02-19 14:56:25","","450-477","","4","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cloud computing; Australia; Consumer guarantees; Consumer law; False representations; Misleading deceptive conduct; Unfair contract terms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, virtual inertia has a time delay, so essentially, it is a fast power response. Meanwhile, virtual inertia control is likely to be affected by frequency fluctuation since it responds to the derivative of frequency. Hence, it’s worth exploring non-virtual inertia control for renewable energy when participating in frequency regulation. For this reason, a novel two-segment droop control scheme for renewable energy frequency regulation is proposed in this research. Firstly, the extended system frequency regulation (SFR) model, which contains virtual inertia with time delay, is built and analytically solved by order decrement based on the Routh approximation method. Afterwards, according to the analytical solution, time delay affects the frequency response of renewable energy. It can also be analytically proved that the non-virtual inertia control, e.g., sole droop control, could replace virtual inertia under the same frequency deviation. Still, more energy may be needed for frequency regulation. Furthermore, a novel two-segment droop control is presented, and to analytically prove its ability to replace virtual inertia, the impulse function balancing principle and the integration by parts algorithm were adopted to address the initial conditions of the differential equation. Based on the analytical expression, it can be analytically proved that a lower frequency deviation can be obtained under the same frequency regulation energy. Accordingly, a parameter-setting method for two-segment droop control was proposed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by using a two-area system frequency response model, and the results reveal that it can be used to replace virtual inertia and has better performance.","2024","2025-02-19 14:56:25","2025-02-19 14:56:25","","110314","","","162","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Frequency regulation; Inertia virtual; Renewable energy; Two-segment droop control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In an era where data privacy concerns are paramount and regulatory landscapes are rapidly evolving, understanding how businesses adapt their models for compliance while fostering innovation is crucial. This paper offers a detailed examination of the legislative requirements imposed by prominent global data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), as well as frameworks from Asia and Africa, such as Singapore's Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) and South Africa's Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA). This inclusive perspective enhances our understanding of how technology businesses strategically adapt across various regulatory environments and explores the operational, financial, and strategic impacts of these laws on tech companies. Utilizing a dual-phase mixed methods research (MMR) design, the study initially analyzes quantitative data from surveys conducted with a wide range of technology firms, assessing the direct effects of data protection legislation on business operations and financial performance. This is complemented by qualitative insights drawn from in-depth interviews with business leaders and legal experts, shedding light on the strategic adaptations, challenges, and opportunities these laws present. The findings reveal a multifaceted impact, highlighting not only the compliance challenges but also the strategic opportunities for innovation and competitive differentiation that data protection laws offer. Integrated analysis of the quantitative and qualitative data provides a nuanced understanding of how tech companies navigate the complex interplay between legal compliance and business model innovation. This study contributes to the existing literature by offering empirical evidence and practical insights into the adaptation processes of tech companies in response to consumer data protection laws. It also provides valuable recommendations for both policymakers and business leaders, aiming to foster an environment where legal compliance coexists with technological innovation and business growth.","2024","2025-02-19 14:56:25","2025-02-19 14:56:25","","102836","","9","48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Business model adaptation; Consumer data protection laws; Mixed methods research; Regulatory impact analysis; Technology industry compliance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Manufacturers often face challenges due to a perceived shortage of valid data sets, highlighting the need for centralized platforms offering high-quality data. While global AI regulations are yet to be established, existing laws govern data collection, creation, labeling, and processing for AI training in various legal systems. The absence of explicit AI laws prompts a call for platforms supplying data to adhere to relevant regulations, especially in areas where AI controls devices interacting with humans, such as collision warning systems in yard tractors and robots. Compliance is crucial, given the complexity of rules governing data sets featuring people, animals, and buildings. The paper focuses on how to check the compliant data sets in Germany’s legal context, focusing on situations in farm yards. People are often visible on such data sets; thus, the data set must preserve the right to informational self-determination and one’s image, which is prevalent in many legal systems. Images portraying people typically qualify as personal data, requiring careful anonymization to address privacy concerns. The paper uses artificial neural networks (ANN) to remove images that contradict people’s rights on one’s image; thus, data sets that comply with data protection laws can be created. It also addresses the lesser-explored issue of the right to one’s image in German law. Though AI training may not be impeded, dissemination via digital platforms must adhere to legal boundaries, even if metadata is absent. The paper suggests an AI solution to identify images within legal limits, detect violations, and modify them to create a legally compliant data set respecting the right to one’s image.","2024","2025-02-19 14:56:25","2025-02-19 14:56:25","","109106","","","223","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Compliance; AI; Farm yard; Legal conform data sets; Right to one’s image","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One possible reason is that there might be more uncited articles than would be predicted by any model if some articles are inherently uncitable. Using data from 23 different Scopus categories, this article tests the assumption that removing a proportion of uncited articles from a citation dataset allows statistical distributions to have much closer fits. It also introduces two new models, zero inflated discretised lognormal distribution and the zero inflated hooked power law distribution and algorithms to fit them. In all 23 cases, the zero inflated version of the discretised lognormal distribution was an improvement on the standard version and in 16 out of 23 cases the zero inflated version of the hooked power law was an improvement on the standard version. Without zero inflation the discretised lognormal models fit the data better than the hooked power law distribution 6 out of 23 times and with it, the discretised lognormal models fit the data better than the hooked power law distribution 9 out of 23 times. Apparently uncitable articles seem to occur due to the presence of academic-related magazines in Scopus categories. In conclusion, future citation analysis and research indicators should take into account uncitable articles, and the best fitting distribution for sets of citation counts from a single subject and year is either the zero inflated discretised lognormal or zero inflated hooked power law.","2016","2025-02-19 14:56:25","2025-02-19 14:56:25","","622-633","","2","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Citation analysis; Discretised lognormal distribution; Hooked power law; Uncited articles; Zero inflated discretised lognormal distribution; Zero inflated hooked power law","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Parallel efforts in regional-scale calibration and application of the MODFLOW-SFR2-RT3D-OTIS stream-aquifer system model permit evaluation of best management practices (BMPs) designed to mollify adverse environmental impacts. Since BMP implementation is allowable only if water laws are not violated, a deep learning model is developed to serve as an accurate, compute-efficient surrogate of MODFLOW-SFR2 and is imbedded in River GeoDSS for assessing basin-scale impacts of BMP implementations on stream-aquifer exchange and water rights.

Online services, instead of supporting the building of social relationships and allowing the free exchange of ideas, are increasingly becoming platforms for spreading hate speech or promoting extremist behaviour. The commitment to respect fundamental rights on which the Union has been built also requires those rights to be protected in cyberspace. Increasingly, one measure implemented to achieve this goal is filtering or blocking illegal content. In recent years, as a result of both the jurisprudence of European courts and the activity of the EU legislature, content filtering measures are increasingly used in an automatic and often also preventive manner. The freedom to use them on the part of digital service providers raises obvious concerns about compliance with human rights standards, often leading to allegations of implementing a new form of “digital censorship”. Assuming that content filtering will be a measure that will be increasingly used in an automatic manner, it is particularly important to establish adequate standards of legal safeguards to protect against the risk of their abuse. The purpose of this article is to explain why the regulations currently being introduced do not create a coherent regulatory model and de facto hamper the effective protection of end-user rights and public security objectives, by introducing a series of often overlapping legal requirements. In this respect, the mosaic of various regulations does not facilitate the definition of a coherent standard of legal safeguards, which in turn delimits the boundaries of the application of automatic content filtering measures.","2022","2025-02-19 14:56:25","2025-02-19 14:56:25","","105739","","","47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Content filtering; Notice and takedown; Online censorship; Prior restraint","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a design aid to information engineers aiming for GDPR compliance, as well as an aid to software users’ understanding of the regulation, this article offers a systematic synthesis and discussion of it, distilled by the mathematical analysis method known as Formal Concept Analysis (FCA). By its principles, GDPR is synthesised as a concept lattice, that is, a formal summary of the regulation, featuring 144372 records — its uses are manifold. For example, the lattice captures so-called attribute implications, the implicit logical relations across the regulation, and their intensity. These results can be used as drivers during systems and services (re-)design, development, operation, or information systems’ refactoring towards more GDPR consistency.","2020","2025-02-19 14:56:25","2025-02-19 14:56:25","","101469","","","91","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GDPR; Formal-concept analysis; Privacy-by-design","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper aims to analyze ad blocking from a unique perspective of the Chinese law and practice. Since ad blocking does not violate copyright law, copyright law cannot be a guardian to the ad-based business model. China takes a different approach to protect the ad-based business model under unfair competition law and bans ad blocking software directly by regulation. The Chinese courts held that providing ad blocking software is anti-competitive under a vague general principle of the Anti-Unfair Competition Law. The special policy reason behind these decisions is that the Chinese government and courts want to maintain this business model and strengthen intellectual property protection. These decisions are reinforced by the regulatory ban of ad blocking software in China. However, the Chinese approach is in the wrong direction. The Chinese courts have applied a principle of “non-interference unless in the public interest” to ad blocking cases but never analyzed the public interest seriously. This paper argues that the “public interest” in the Internet context should be the interests of Internet users. The group of Internet users is large enough to constitute the general public. The public have a compelling interest of autonomy to justify ad blocking. The right approach to solving the ad blocking problem should be flexible, easily adjustable and it should not totally fail one side. Compared to direct regulatory intervention, a flexible judicial approach is better because it could take into consideration a variety of interests and strike a balance in specific cases. And, to regulate new technologies, a soft version of guidelines could be easily adjustable than an immature regulation. The Internet itself is a creative industry developed under the process of “creative destruction”. Any legal intervention shall be careful and not impede the emerging technologies, market structure development and autonomous competition.","2017","2025-02-19 14:56:25","2025-02-19 14:56:25","","786-801","","6","33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Copyright; Ad blocking; Creative destruction; Governmental intervention; Unfair competition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thirdly, we present a bias-removal algorithm, called SEaCorAl, able to effectively reduce bias effects and improve the biological significance of correlation analysis.

Judicial views typically include judgment information on the merits such as charges, law articles, and sentencing circumstances. There are several issues with using universal algorithms to generate text, such as a lack of professional expression required for legal documents, and missing or incorrect judgment information on the merits. Judicial views often involve judgment information on the merits, rather than summarizing and excerpting known information. This could be why the application of conventional text generation algorithms may not produce satisfactory results. In actual judicial scenarios, judges generate their views step by step. Firstly, identify multiple judgment information on the merits in the judicial views, and then connect them with legal templates to achieve the generation of judicial views. This article proposes a Template Based Legal Information Generation (TBLIG) framework that generates higher quality judicial views based on the authentic judicial reasoning methods used by judges. The method consists of two steps: The first step involves determining the judgment information on the merits in the judicial view, while the second step involves synchronously generating a legal template based on the case.

Through comparison with other models and ablation experiments, we have proved the effectiveness of our proposed method.","2024","2025-02-19 14:56:25","2025-02-19 14:56:25","","112232","","","301","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Legal AI; Judgment information on the merits; Judicial view generation; Multiple subtasks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, there are cases where the LLM recommends actions that have potential legal implications and this may put the user in danger. We provide an empirical analysis on multiple existing LLMs showing the urgency of the problem. Hence, we propose a first short-term solution, consisting in an approach for isolating these legal issues through prompt engineering. We prove that this solution is able to stem some risks related to legal implications, nonetheless we also highlight some limitations. Hence, we argue on the need for additional knowledge-intensive resources and specifically Knowledge Graphs for fully solving these limitations. For the purpose, we draw our proposal aiming at designing and developing a solution powered by a legal Knowledge Graph (KG) that, besides capturing and alerting the user on possible legal implications coming from the LLM answers, is also able to provide actual evidence for them by supplying citations of the interested laws.

Basically, legal rule-bases rely on literal interpretations of statutes. In practice, however, literal interpretation of statute can have counterintuitive consequences. To deal with such consequences, English courts (the courts of England and Wales) have developed rules of judicial interpretation for reinterpreting statutes i.e. choosing or modifying the meaning of the statute’s wording (golden rule) or determining the statute’s purpose (mischief rule), and these rules have not been investigated in computational law. Previous research proposed the concept of legal debugging to formalize detection and resolution of counterintuitive consequences in legal rule-bases. Legal debugging consists of two steps. The first step is culprit detection, which involves interacting with a judge in order to identify a culprit, which is intuitively a part of statute that can be determined as a root cause of counterintuitive consequences. The second step is culprit resolution, which involves revising the rule-base to resolve a detected culprit. In this paper, we match two inductive logic programming approaches to two rules of judicial interpretation. The first approach is a bottom-up approach, which involves identifying an exceptional situation of the case and generalizing the legal rule revision. We match the bottom-up approach to the golden rule by using knowledge bases in the form of legal ontologies. The second approach is a top-down approach, which involves determining the purpose of the statute and refining the legal rule revision so that the revision fits within the context of the statute. We match the top-down approach to the mischief rule by using knowledge bases in the form of metarules. By using these matches, legal debugging can perform more practical legal revisions during the culprit resolution step.","2022","2025-02-19 14:56:25","2025-02-19 14:56:25","","105696","","","46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Legal reasoning; Algorithmic law; Legal debugging","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We present a novel model, that accounts for these argumentation phenomena. An evaluation study showed that arguments about the significance of distinctions based on this model help predict the outcome of cases in the area of trade secrets law, confirming the quality of these arguments. The model forms the basis of an intelligent learning environment called CATO, which was designed to help beginning law students acquire basic argumentation skills. CATO uses the model for a number of purposes, including the dynamic generation of argumentation examples. In a second evaluation study, carried out in the context of an actual legal writing course, we compared instruction with CATO against the best traditional legal writing instruction. The results indicate that CATO's example-based instructional approach is effective in teaching basic argumentation skills. However, a more “integrated” approach appears to be needed if students are to achieve better transfer of these skills to more complex contexts.

Three-dimensional macroscopic muscle models (3D models) can more accurately represent muscle architecture than their 1D (line-segment) counterparts. Nevertheless, 3D models remain underutilised in academic, clinical, and commercial environments. Among the reasons for this is a lack of modelling and simulation standardisation, verification, and validation. Here, we strive towards a solution by providing an open-access, characterised, constitutive relation (CR) for 3D musculotendon models. Methods: The musculotendon complex is modelled following the state-of-the-art active stress approach and is treated as hyperelastic, transversely isotropic, and nearly incompressible. Furthermore, force-length and -velocity relationships are incorporated, and muscle activation is derived from motor-unit information. The CR was implemented within the commercial finite-element software package Abaqus as a user-subroutine. A masticatory system model with left and right masseters was used to demonstrate active and passive movement. Results: The CR was characterised by various experimental data sets and was able to capture a wide variety of passive and active behaviours. Furthermore, the masticatory simulations revealed that joint movement was sensitive to the muscle’s in-fibre passive response. Conclusions: This user-material provides a “plug and play” template for 3D neuro-musculoskeletal finite element modelling. We hope that this reduces modelling effort, fosters exchange, and contributes to the standardisation of such models.","2022","2025-02-19 14:56:25","2025-02-19 14:56:25","","107152","","","226","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Abaqus; Constitutive relation; Continuum mechanics; Finite element; Motor-units; Skeletal muscle","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, it has been suggested that the making of an inference-based decision may be accompanied by an increase in the coherence of assessments of the individual arguments related to the alternatives at hand. This suggests a constraint satisfaction reasoning process. In two complex and ambiguous law-related emerging decisions, assessments of inferences increasingly spread apart, even if no additional information was provided. Two approaches for studying emerging coherence are developed. First, the structures that emerge as participants progress from stage to stage in the judgment process are captured as principal components through factor analysis.

Continuous improvements of these off-the-shelf provers, without further ado, leverage the reasoning performance in LogiKEy.

Particular focus is given to the class of “active” telemedicine systems, that imply a real-world, non-mediated, interaction with the final user. A secondary objective is to give an overview of the European legal framework that applies to these systems, in the effort to avoid defensive medicine practices and fears, which might be a barrier to their broader adoption. Methods We leverage on the experience gained during two international telemedicine projects, namely MobiGuide (pilot studies conducted in Spain and Italy) and AP@home (clinical trials enrolled patients in Italy, France, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Austria and Germany), whose development our group has significantly contributed to in the last 4 years, to create a map of the potential criticalities of active telemedicine systems and comment upon the legal framework that applies to them. Two workshops have been organized in December 2015 and March 2016 where the topic has been discussed in round tables with system developers, researchers, physicians, nurses, legal experts, healthcare economists and administrators. Results We identified 8 features that generate relevant risks from our example use cases. These features generalize to a broad set of telemedicine applications, and suggest insights on possible risk mitigation strategies. We also discuss the relevant European legal framework that regulate this class of systems, providing pointers to specific norms and highlighting possible liability profiles for involved stakeholders. Conclusions Patients are more and more willing to adopt telemedicine systems to improve home care and day-by-day self-management. An essential step towards a broader adoption of these systems consists in increasing their compliance with existing regulations and better defining responsibilities for all the involved stakeholders.","2018","2025-02-19 14:56:26","2025-02-19 14:56:26","","90-98","","","112","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Liability; Legal aspects; Medical device; mHealth; Practice guideline; Telemedicine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The complexity of regulations is the root cause of the emergence of automated solutions for compliance assessment by translating regulations into sets of machine-processable rules that can be run by specialized modules of farm management information systems (FMIS). However, the manual translation of rules is prohibitively costly, and therefore, this translation should be carried out with the support of artificial intelligence techniques. In this paper, we use the official Spanish phytosanitary products registry to empirically evaluate the performance of four popular machine learning algorithms in the task of correctly classifying pesticide regulations as prohibitions or obligations. Moreover, we also evaluate how to improve the performance of the algorithms in the preprocessing of the texts with natural language processing techniques. Finally, due to the specific characteristics of the texts found in pesticide regulations, resampling techniques are also evaluated. Experiments show that the combination of the machine learning algorithm Logic regression, the natural language technique part-of-speech tagging and the resampling technique Tomek links is the best performing approach, with an F1 score of 68.8%, a precision of 84.46% and a recall of 60%. The experimental results are promising, and they show that this approach can be applied to develop a computer-aided tool for transforming textual pesticide regulations into machine-processable rules.

Generating high-quality summaries of court judgment documents can facilitate legal practitioners to efficiently review previous cases and assist the general public in accessing how the courts operate and how the law is applied. Previous court judgment summarization research focuses on civil law or a particular jurisdiction’s judgments. However, judges can refer to the judgments from all common law jurisdictions. Current summarization datasets are insufficient to satisfy the demands of summarizing precedents across multiple jurisdictions, especially when labeled data are scarce for many jurisdictions. To address the lack of datasets, we present CLSum, the first dataset for summarizing multi-jurisdictional common law court judgment documents. Besides, this is the first court judgment summarization work adopting large language models (LLMs) in data augmentation, summary generation, and evaluation. Specifically, we design an LLM-based data augmentation method incorporating legal knowledge. We also propose a legal knowledge enhanced evaluation metric based on LLM to assess the quality of generated judgment summaries. Our experimental results verify that the LLM-based summarization methods can perform well in the few-shot and zero-shot settings.

We first introduce LATO-KM, the knowledge model of LATO where legal knowledge featuring documents in the collection is properly formalized as conceptual knowledge, in form of legal concepts and relationships, and terminological knowledge, in form of term-sets associated with legal concepts. Then, we present the bootstrapping cycle of CRIKE that aims to progressively enrich the terminological knowledge layer of LATO by extracting new terms from legal documents to be used for enriching the term-set associated with a corresponding legal concept. Finally, to evaluate the results obtained through CRIKE, we discuss experimental results on a real dataset of 180,000 court decisions of the State of Illinois taken from the Caselaw Access Project (CAP).","2022","2025-02-19 14:56:26","2025-02-19 14:56:26","","101842","","","106","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Legal document retrieval and exploration; Legal knowledge extraction; Legal knowledge model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This type of system can automatically link related legal documents to ensure that the same situations are treated identically in judicial practice. Most existing methodologies propose text- and citation-based methods to calculate the similarity between legal documents. However, those methods have difficulty capturing the semantics of many legal entities and giving more accurate similarity. The main reason is the lack of legal domain knowledge and citation relations between legal documents. We introduce practical, generic heterogeneous graph representation learning based on a legal heterogeneous knowledge graph to address these challenges. Specifically, we construct a heterogeneous knowledge graph containing legal entities and documents and develop a graph-based embedding model called L-HetGRL. A legal entity can simply be simply a legal-related encyclopedia entry that contains legal-domain knowledge utilized to enhance document representation. L-HetGRL incorporates learning legal document information and external legal domain knowledge in a unified manner by jointly considering heterogeneous content. In addition, we designed a legal case-aware semantic alignment module that effectively combines legal entities and their semantics in documents, thus improving the representation of entities. We conducted comprehensive experiments, including similar case matching and charge prediction, to evaluate the performance of our L-HetGRL on two real-world datasets. As a result, the experimental evaluations demonstrate that L-HetGRL outperforms other competitive baselines. In addition, we present a series of suggestions for document representation in the legal domain, which provide valuable guidelines for follow-up studies.","2022","2025-02-19 14:56:26","2025-02-19 14:56:26","","109046","","","250","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Legal document similarity; Heterogeneous content; Legal-domain knowledge graph; Representation learning; Semantic alignment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Regulations affect not only current emission levels, but also the effect on investment in R&D or new plant and equipment and, consequently, on competitive priorities. Although most of the literature devoted to the environmental regulation highlights the effects that legislation has on the adoption of decisions related to the environment as a competitive opportunity, there is actually no strong empirical evidence which supports that argument. This is why the present paper has as its aim to identify (1) how the regulation concerning the natural environment differs across sectors and (2) how it can influence managerial perceptions of the role to be played by the natural environment as a competitive opportunity. The research work has been carried out in two phases. The first phase involved comparative case studies of eight Spanish firms; during the second, the propositions emerging from the first phase were tested through a structural equation model of 239 hotels and 208 firms affected by the IPPC law in Spain. This paper has made a contribution to the existing research literature through the examination of the similarities and differences concerning managerial decision-making in the field of natural environment regulations. Moreover, a contact point between the Porter hypothesis and its criticism is offered. In relation to practical implications, updated information about the European, National and Community environmental legislation is presented that affects firms from eight sectors. In this context, legal environmental requirements are identified so as to make easier the adoption of managerial decisions which guarantee compliance with the law and avoidance of fines.","2009","2025-02-19 14:56:26","2025-02-19 14:56:26","","497-518","","2","195","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Government; Competitiveness; Environment; Multivariate statistics; Pollution control and prevention","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The chapter presents a distinction between two aspects: expressiveness and engineering principles. The first concerns what can be built, and the second concerns how it should be built. The first determines what can be represented in formalism: the formalism of the Toolkit is, for example, inadequate in its treatment of time and modal knowledge. Given this inadequacy, applications can still be built, but their functionality would be limited. Thus, in the policy application, all the distinctively modal reasoning should be performed by the user, although he is supported in this by the non-modal reasoning of the system. The legal domain does make certain demands on the expressiveness of a representation, and the nature of the application to be built would depend on how well these demands are met.","1991","2025-02-19 14:56:26","2025-02-19 14:56:26","","245-263","","","36","","","","APIC","","","","Academic Press","London","","","","","","","","DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-086441-6.50020-9","","","","","","BENCH-CAPON, T.

However, it has inherent defects in measurement error amplification due to the frequency differential. Also, when control delay of wind turbines is taken into consideration, virtual inertia is essentially a fast power response, just the same as droop control. Hence, considering the adaptability of droop control, it is valuable to explore a novel droop control method without virtual inertia, as the frequency response model of wind turbines. For this reason, a multi-segment droop control strategy is proposed to provide a reliable frequency regulation model for wind turbines that can be broadly applied to other inverter-based power sources. Firstly, based on the extended system frequency response model, a differential equation including piecewise time-varying coefficients is established, and the analytical expression of the frequency response is obtained using the impulse function balancing principle and the integration by parts algorithm. Subsequently, based on analytical expression, the performance of the presented strategy is theoretically analyzed via comparison with virtual inertia control, and the conclusion that the presented multi-segment droop control has better frequency regulation performance can be got. Furthermore, to achieve optimal frequency regulation performance, a Lagrangian function is established to determine the optimal parameters of the proposed control strategy. Finally, the performance of the proposed strategy was verified in a two-area system model constructed on MATLAB/Simulink. Results show that the proposed multi-segment droop control has better frequency regulation performance.","2024","2025-02-19 14:56:26","2025-02-19 14:56:26","","109968","","","158","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Frequency regulation; Multi-segment droop control; Parameter setting; Virtual inertia; Wind turbine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In part because sex differences in blood pressure regulation mechanisms are not sufficiently well understood, fewer hypertensive women achieve blood pressure control compared to men, even though compliance and treatment rates are generally higher in women. Thus, the objective of this study is to identify which factors contribute to the sexual dimorphism in response to anti-hypertensive therapies targeting the renin angiotensin system (RAS). To accomplish that goal, we develop sex-specific blood pressure regulation models. Sex differences in the RAS, baseline adosterone level, and the reactivity of renal sympathetic nervous activity (RSNA) are represented. A novel aspect of the model is the representation of sex-specific vasodilatory effect of the bound angiotensin II type two receptor (AT2R-bound Ang II) on renal vascular resistance. Model simulations suggest that sex differences in RSNA are the largest cause of female resistance to developing hypertension due to the direct influence of RSNA on afferent arteriole resistance. Furthermore, the model predicts that the sex-specific vasodilatory effects of AT2R-bound Ang II on renal vascular resistance may explain the higher effectiveness of angiotensin receptor blockers in treating hypertensive women (but not men), compared to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors.","2019","2025-02-19 14:56:26","2025-02-19 14:56:26","","139-148","","","104","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ACE inhibitors; Angiotensin receptor blockers; Blood pressure; Hypertension; renin angiotensin system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the case of the legal domain, the research community agrees that a system allowing to generate of automatic responses to legal questions could substantially impact many practical implications in daily activities.

In a kind of “reflective adjustment”, they fit the new problem into a patchwork of past case decisions, comparing cases in order to reason about the legal significance of the relevant similarities and differences.

Currently, legal AI systems face difficulties in representing legal knowledge, exhibit insufficient legal reasoning capabilities, have poor explainability, and are inefficient in handling causal inference and uncertainty. In legal practice, various legal reasoning methods (deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, abductive reasoning, etc.) are often intertwined and used comprehensively. However, the reasoning modes employed by current legal AI systems are inadequate. Identifying AI models that are more suitable for legal reasoning is crucial for advancing the development of legal AI systems. Distinguished from the current high-profile large language models, we believe that Bayesian reasoning is highly compatible with legal reasoning, as it can perferm abductive reasoning, excel at causal inference, and admits the ""defeasibility"" of reasoning conclusions, which is consistent with the cognitive development pattern of legal professionals from apriori to posteriori. AI models based on Bayesian methods can also become the main technological support for legal AI systems. Bayesian neural networks have advantages in uncertainty modeling, avoiding overfitting, and explainability. Legal AI systems based on Bayesian deep learning frameworks can combine the advantages of deep learning and probabilistic graphical models, facilitating the exchange and supplementation of information between perception tasks and reasoning tasks. In this paper, we take perpetrator prediction systems and legal judegment prediction systems as examples to discuss the construction and basic operation modes of the Bayesian deep learning framework. Bayesian deep learning can enhance reasoning ability, improve the explainability of models, and make the reasoning process more transparent and visualizable. Furthermore, Bayesian deep learning framework is well-suited for human-machine collaborative tasks, enabling the complementary strengths of humans and machines.","2024","2025-02-19 14:56:26","2025-02-19 14:56:26","","106073","","","55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Deep learning; Legal AI; Legal reasoning; Bayesian deep learning; Bayesian neural networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Law firms are vigilant in recognizing the potential risks of violating confidentiality and inappropriate exposure of sensitive legal data through the prompt sent to Generative AI. This research attempts to find an equilibrium between responsible usage and control of human legal professionals over content produced by Generative AI through regular audits. It investigates the potential of Generative AI in drafting correspondence for pre-litigation decisions derived from an eXplainable AI (XAI) algorithm. This research presents an end-to-end process of designing the architecture and methodology for a blockchain-based auditing system. It detects unauthorized alterations of data repositories containing the decisions by an XAI model and automated textual explanation by Generative AI. The automated auditing by blockchain facilitates responsible usage of AI technologies and reduces discrepancies in tracing the accountability of adversarial decisions. It conceptualizes the two algorithms. First, strategic on-chain (within blockchain) and off-chain (outside blockchain) data storage in compliance with the data protection laws and critical requirements of stakeholders in a legal firm. Second, auditing by comparison of the unique signature as Merkle roots of files stored off-chain with their immutable blockchain counterpart. A case study on liability cases under tort law demonstrates the system implementation results.","2024","2025-02-19 14:56:26","2025-02-19 14:56:26","","107666","","","129","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Law; Generative AI; Blockchain; Explainable AI; Legal; Responsible AI","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Sections I and II of this essay give an account of the results of the ongoing doctrinal debate, which is not univocal. The objective is to provide an assessment of both the advantages and limitations associated with smart legal contracts. In Section III, the authors introduce a novel negotiation process termed ""contracts on chain"". This process enables parties to engage in negotiations, formalize agreements and execute contracts directly on the blockchain. Consequently, this negotiation approach serves as a potential bridge between the realms of Web 2 and Web 3. Further, it offers a user experience akin to online contracts but benefits from the inherent capabilities of third-generation blockchains. Albeit on-chain contracts can be deployed on both private and public blockchains, the authors express a preference for their use on the public blockchain within a ""logical platform"". This choice allows to enhance regulatory compliance and mitigate the effects of decentralization on liability regimes, while simultaneously optimizing the efficiency gains of public blockchains. Notably, this approach ensures a level of protection commensurate with that offered by private blockchains. The ultimate goal of this innovative process is to streamline the ongoing technological transition and cultivate greater trust within the market for emerging technologies.","2024","2025-02-19 14:56:26","2025-02-19 14:56:26","","106035","","","55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Blockchain; Regulation; Smart contracts; Contracts on chain; Smart legal contracts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although previous information security researchers have investigated different motivational factors related to ISP compliance, most have not recognized different forms of ISP compliance behaviors characterized by their levels of willingness and persistence, nor have they noted the importance of adopting an other-oriented lens to examine such behaviors. In this paper, we propose and test an integrated model that investigates how various motivational factors affect different ISP compliance behaviors. Specifically, the model anchors on the prosocial motivational perspective in addition to the instrumental and self-regulatory motivational perspectives and investigates two types of compliance behaviors (voluntary ISP compliance and instrumental ISP compliance). We tested our model using survey data collected from 407 employee respondents. Our results show that the three sets of motivational factors have different effects on the two types of ISP compliance behaviors. Prosocial motivation and self-regulatory motivation positively affect voluntary ISP compliance behavior. Deterrence as an instrumental control leads to instrumental ISP compliance behavior but undermines voluntary ISP compliance behavior. Our study highlights that, to foster employees’ voluntary ISP compliance, organizations need to take a more holistic approach by integrating the prosocial approach with the instrumental and self-regulatory approaches in managing voluntary compliance behaviors, while being mindful of the negative effects of instrumental controls (e.g., deterrence) on such behaviors.","2022","2025-02-19 14:56:26","2025-02-19 14:56:26","","102568","","","113","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Information security; Deterrence; Information security policy; Instrumental compliance; Legitimacy; Other-oriented perspective taking; Prosocial motivation; Self-regulatory motivation; Value congruence; Voluntary compliance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The key question is therefore how this space can be navigated efficiently, to focus on mechanisms and models that are biologically relevant. In this review, we advocate for the normative role of theory—theory that prescribes rather than just describes—in providing such a focus. Theory should expand its remit beyond inferring mechanistic models from data, towards identifying non-equilibrium gene regulatory schemes that may have been evolutionarily selected, despite their energy consumption, because they are precise, reliable, fast, or otherwise outperform regulation at equilibrium.

Conventional document retrieval systems involve the matching of a query against individual documents, whereas a clustered search compares a query with clusters of documents, thereby achieving efficient retrieval. In most document databases, periodic updating of clusters is required due to the dynamic nature of a database. Experimental evidence, however, shows that clustered searches are substantially less effective than conventional searches of corresponding non-clustered documents.

The escalating magnitude of national and international laws and regulations, such as Sarbanes–Oxley, Gramm–Leach–Bliley and Basel II, caused organisations to become increasingly aware of the importance of legal compliance and the obligations that arise from it. The challenge of meeting these obligations has become a complex web of requirements that grows exponentially as organisations cross international boundaries. This paper attempts to provide an interpretation of the legal aspects, as a starting point for clarifying compliance issues, as referred to by ISO/IEC 27002 (ISO/IEC 27002, 2005; previously known as ISO/IEC 17799, 2005). ISO/IEC 27002 further mentions three sources from which information security requirements can be derived, of which one will be focused on within this paper, namely the legal requirements. The interpretation of the legal aspects thus forms the foundation for motivating a proposed model for determining legal requirements, which in turn, indicates relevant information security controls from the list provided in ISO/IEC 27002, to satisfy the identified legal requirements.","2008","2025-02-19 14:56:26","2025-02-19 14:56:26","","124-135","","5","27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Compliance; Information security; Legal requirements; Information security management; Information security requirements; ISO/IEC 17799; ISO/IEC 27002","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ethification shall be understood as a proliferation of moral principles and moral values in the legal discourse within the areas of research, innovation governance, or directly enforceable rules in the industry. Although the ethical considerations may seem distant from mere regulatory compliance, the opposite is true. The article focuses on the positive side of the “ethification” of digital laws through the lens of legal requirements for impact assessments pursuant to General Data Protection Regulation and conformity assessments in the proposal for the Artificial Intelligence Act. Authors argue that ethical considerations are often absent in the context of using new technologies including artificial intelligence, yet they may provide additional value for organizations and society as a whole. Additionally, carrying out ethics-based assessments is already in line with existing regulatory requirements in the fields of data protection law and proposed EU AI regulation. These arguments are reflected in the context of facial recognition technology, where both data protection impact assessment under the EU General Data Protection Regulation and conformity assessment under the proposal of the EU Artificial Intelligence Act will be mandatory. Facial recognition technology is analyzed through the ethics-based assessment involving stakeholder analysis, data flows map, and identification of risks and respective countermeasures to show additional insights that ethics provides beyond regulatory requirements.","2023","2025-02-19 14:56:26","2025-02-19 14:56:26","","105852","","","50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Data protection; Ethics; Artificial intelligence; Law; Impact assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This study aims to investigate the plausible role of reflex regulation in biomimetic control for tendon-driven prosthetic hands. Eleven subjects with forearm amputations participated in force control tasks and functional tasks. The force control tasks were performed using either the prosthetic forefinger or the entire hand. The functional tasks of varying difficulties included the standard rigid object test (SROT), refined rigid object test (RROT), and fragile object test (FOT). Additionally, the stiffness properties of biomimetic control were tested prior to the human-in-loop evaluations. Closed-loop control (CLC) with integrated proprioceptive feedback and open-loop control (OLC) were employed for assessments. Results showed that the reflex regulation contributed significantly to the increase by 20.4% in success rate, 17.9% in effective throughput, and 65.7% decrease in break rate during in the pressing force control task. CLC consistently outperformed OLC across all indices. Indeed, the gripping force control task revealed comparable trends as well.

As countries strive to meet their climate goals and reduce carbon emissions, the energy transition has become a critical imperative. In this endeavor, the role of regulatory sandboxes has emerged as a promising approach to foster innovation, accelerate technological advancements and overcome regulatory barriers in the energy sector. Many regulatory authorities introduce legislations incorporating the concept of ‘sandbox’ to create a regulatory framework and an experimental environment that encourages participation and integrates infrastructure with new technologies and business processes for facilitating and accelerating the energy transition. With the help of sandbox applications, the designated test or pilot implementations provide protected spaces for projects to allow regulatory trials and the development of required regulations. This study aims to examine and compare regulatory sandbox and pilot project experiences in selected countries to explore technological requirements, and recommendations for effective regulation. A four-dimensional/key perspectives framework was designed to analyze and compare selected countries. The reviewed projects were qualitatively summarized and categorized in a thematic synthesis based on a combined systematic review approach. Key findings underscore the significance of regulatory frameworks and provide clear guidance to stakeholders in innovative energy initiatives. Furthermore, collaboration, precise project delineations, and the preservation of technology neutrality emerge as crucial factors. Addressing challenges like grid integration, resource limitations, and regulatory adherence prove pivotal for the prosperous evolution of the energy domain.

The architectures evaluated do not require feature engineering and, hence, they are applicable to the agricultural regulations of different countries. The best system is a neural network that uses character embeddings, Bidirectional Long short-term memory and Softmax. It achieves a performance of 88.3% F1 score.","2019","2025-02-19 14:56:26","2025-02-19 14:56:26","","106-111","","","162","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Deep learning; Natural language processing; Compliance control; Rule extraction; Sequence labeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By the law, we mean national or European laws that require the removal of content by online platforms, such as EU Regulation 2021/784, which addresses the dissemination of terrorist content online. Content moderation required by these national or European laws, summarised here as ‘the law’, is different from the moderation of pieces of content that is not directly required by law but instead is conducted voluntarily by the platforms. New regulatory requests create an additional layer of complexity of legal grounds for the moderation of content and are relevant to platforms’ daily decisions. The decisions made are either grounded in reasons stemming from different sources of law, such as international or national provisions, or can be based on contractual grounds, such as the platform's Terms of Service and Community Standards. However, how to empirically measure these essential aspects of content moderation remains unclear. Therefore, we ask the following research question: How do online platforms interpret the law when they moderate online content? To understand this complex interplay and empirically test the quality of a platform's content moderation claims, this article develops a methodology that facilitates empirical evidence of the individual decisions taken per piece of content while highlighting the subjective element of content classification by human moderators. We then apply this methodology to a single empirical case, an anonymous medium-sized German platform that provided us access to their content moderation decisions. With more knowledge of how platforms interpret the law, we can better understand the complex nature of content moderation, its regulation and compliance practices, and to what degree legal moderation might differ from moderation due to contractual reasons in dimensions such as the need for context, information, and time. Our results show considerable divergence between the platform's interpretation of the law and ours. We believe that a significant number of platform legal interpretations are incorrect due to divergent interpretations of the law and that platforms are removing legal content that they falsely believe to be illegal (‘overblocking’) while simultaneously not moderating illegal content (‘underblocking’). In conclusion, we provide recommendations for content moderation system design that takes (legal) human content moderation into account and creates new methodological ways to test its quality and effect on speech in online platforms.","2024","2025-02-19 14:56:34","2025-02-19 14:56:34","","106054","","","55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Content moderation; Digital services act; Freedom of Expression; Germany; Illegal content; Social media","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The actual implementation of laws surrounding intellectual property, privacy, reasonable searches, and breach notification, to name a few, differ among various regions of the world, but the importance of these concepts is still universal. These systems provide the framework that determines how a country develops laws pertaining to information systems in the first place. The three major systems of law are civil, common, and religious. Within common law there are various branches of laws, including criminal, civil, and administrative. Examples of legal concepts that affect information security include crimes committed or aided by computer systems, attacks on intellectual property, privacy concerns, and international issues. The purpose of intellectual property law is to control the use of intangible property that can often be trivial to reproduce or abuse once made public or known. Investigations are a critical way in which information security professionals come into contact with the law. They are commonly carried out by forensics and incident response personnel, both of whom need a basic understanding of legal matters to ensure that the legal merits of the investigation are not unintentionally tarnished. Evidence, and the appropriate method for handling it, is a critical legal issue that all information security professionals must understand. This chapter also presents the IAB's RFC on Ethics and the Internet, the Computer Ethics Institute's Ten Commandments of Computer Ethics, and the (ISC) Code of Ethics.","2011","2025-02-19 14:56:34","2025-02-19 14:56:34","","161-174","","","","","","","","","","","Syngress","Boston","","","","","","","","DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-1-59749-566-0.00010-2","","","","","","Conrad, Eric","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Without being specific to any particular industry, these legal concerns and risks are identified and subsumed under three general perspectives, namely, contract disputes, liability for defects and delays, and labor and employment issues. Drawing on academic literature, statutes, acts, and court cases of relevance, this article dwells on these three perspectives as they matter to project management in general, cites the related key legal statutes and acts in these three perspectives in respect of project management, illuminates the statues’ and acts’ essence, and compares them across the aforementioned jurisdictions. Some salient findings are that Macao, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Hong Kong all appear to resemble each other in the legal regulation of the three aforesaid perspectives such that project management and project manager seem to be prone to rather similar legal concerns and risks across all these jurisdictions. However, in fact, it is more challenging in Macao for project managers to evaluate and manage legal concerns and risks than in the other jurisdictions above because of two reasons. First, Macao’s legal framework is so distinct and unique that project managers are not able to evaluate the impact, incidence, and probability of any legal risk’s happening by analogy with the precedent court cases elsewhere. Second, there is a key difference between Macao as a small jurisdiction and the other jurisdictions above in that the former is inevitably short of a substantial volume of local precedent court cases. This dearth of local precedent court cases substantively hinders a project manager from evaluating the impact, incidence, and probability of any legal concern’s or risk’s happening.","2024","2025-02-19 14:56:34","2025-02-19 14:56:34","","1990-1997","","","239","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","legal concerns; legal risks; mitigate; project management; Project manager","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For ICT's future emissions, we explore assumptions underlying analysts' projections to understand the reasons for their variability. All analysts agree that ICT emissions will not reduce without major concerted efforts involving broad political and industrial action. We provide three reasons to believe ICT emissions are going to increase barring intervention and find that not all carbon pledges in the ICT sector are ambitious enough to meet climate targets. We explore the underdevelopment of policy mechanisms for enforcing sector-wide compliance, and contend that, without a global carbon constraint, a new regulatory framework is required to keep the ICT sector's footprint aligned with the Paris Agreement.","2021","2025-02-19 14:56:34","2025-02-19 14:56:34","","100340","","9","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","AI; blockchain; regulations; big data; IoT; carbon footprint; data science; ICT; policy; trends","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The GCL arises naturally in the context of Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulations for solving problems on deforming domains. GCL compliance is traditionally interpreted as a consistency criterion for applying an unsteady flow solution algorithm to simulate exactly a uniform flow on a deforming domain. We introduce an additional requirement: the time integrator must maintain its fixed mesh accuracy when applied to deforming meshes. A review of the literature shows that while many authors use an ALE FEM, few of them discuss the GCL issues. We show how a fixed mesh unsteady FEM using high order time integrator (up to fifth order in time) can be transposed to solve problems on deforming meshes and preserve its fixed mesh high order temporal accuracy. An appropriate construction of the divergence of the mesh velocity guarantees GCL compliance while a separate construction of the mesh velocity itself allows the time-integrator to deliver its fixed mesh high order temporal accuracy on deforming domains. Analytical error analysis of problems with closed form solutions provides insight on the behavior of the time integrators. It also explains why high order temporal accuracy is achieved with a conservative formulation of the incompressible Navier–Stokes equations, while only first order time accuracy is observed with the non-conservative formulation and all time-integrators investigated here. We present thorough time-step and grid refinement studies for simple problems with closed form solutions and for a manufactured solution with a non-trivial flow on a deforming mesh. In all cases studied, the proposed reconstructions of the mesh velocity and its divergence for the conservative formulation lead to optimal time accuracy on deforming grids.","2009","2025-02-19 14:56:34","2025-02-19 14:56:34","","2313-2333","","7","228","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Arbitrary Lagragian Eulerian; Finite element method; Geometric conservation law; High order time integrators; Incompressible flow simulations; Navier–Stokes equations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is because the law does not regulate what is good and even lawful activities may lead to harms. At the same time, data ethics requires clear guidelines that can be adopted by organizations. To address this, the authors propose situating data protection within the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) paradigm. This incentivizes the adoption of ethical practices thanks to the potential for organizations to improve their ESG rantings. To this end, the Maastricht University Data Protection as a Corporate Social Responsibility Framework is provided as a solution. The Framework provides actionable and auditable controls with the ultimate aim of promoting responsible data practices that benefit not only businesses, but also individuals and society. Novelty and contribution to knowledge: This paper builds upon the work illustrated in Data Protection as a Corporate Social Responsibility (Edward Elgar, 2023) to provide an overview of the need for taking an ethical approach to data protection and cybersecurity compliance. It provides new insights into the relationship between ethics and data protection law and makes new connections between ESG and data protection. Essentially, it delves deeper into the potential for framing data protection under ESG to act as an incentive for virtuous data protection compliance to be achieved by companies.","2024","2025-02-19 14:56:34","2025-02-19 14:56:34","","100099","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Corporate Social Responsibility; Data protection; Digital ethics; ESG; Ethics; GDPR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To a limited extent this may have been true historically (particularly as a result of its closed user community). However, this is no longer the case. As business and commerce move to exploit the economic potential of the Internet, the authorities that police and regulate everyday activities are focusing increasingly their attention on the Internet, using existing laws and powers to regulate activity over the ‘Net’. Whilst it may be true that in many instances the existing laws sit uncomfortably with a system that ignores national boundaries, nonetheless activities on the Internet are regulated and subjected to the application of both criminal and civil laws. The use of the Internet is unlikely to bring the activity in question outside the scope of the relevant legislation. In many instances, use of the Internet may well complicate further existing regulatory issues and, unless careful consideration is given to the issues, Web site owners could easily find themselves subject to regulatory regimes in other countries and subject to criminal sanctions for non-compliance. This article is intended to increase awareness of some of the issues, with particular emphasis on use of the Internet in dealing with consumers. It is not an exhaustive list! Just as the technology is developing in this field, so too is legal thinking and the law both in its implementation and interpretation: accepted practices today may well be tomorrow's heresy. It should be stressed that this paper is written from an English law perspective but a number of the issues raised are issues which will be relevant in every jurisdiction — E-commerce is now a global issue.","1998","2025-02-19 14:56:34","2025-02-19 14:56:34","","232-242","","4","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Data protection law protects individuals against risks associated with the processing of “personal data”. However, despite an intensive legal debate, there is still considerable uncertainty as to when data is personal data and when it is not. The reason for this is that data such as technical data or geo-location data usually is not “personal” per se but only when it is used for a specific purpose and in a specific way, or to be more precise, when the data processing causes a specific risk to a fundamental right of an individual. In our paper, we demonstrate that by focusing on these risks when assessing the scope of application, the question whether data falls into the scope of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or not becomes much clearer. The about, purpose, and result elements, introduced by the Art. 29 Working Party, thereby turn out to be a powerful set of analytical tools to determine which rights are specifically affected by data processing and, thus, to what extent a data subject is identified or identifiable in the processing context. While the about element addresses different risks to the right to privacy, the purpose element specifically reveals risks to the autonomy status of an individual. Finally, the result element focuses on the negative effect data processing can have on any other fundamental rights of the individual. On this basis, it is also possible to define more precisely the legal requirements for anonymising personal data. First of all, we illustrate that anonymisation mainly affects the about element and can do little “against” the purpose and result element. At least, however, by assessing which sphere of privacy is specifically concerned, it is possible to more precisely define when an individual is identified in a dataset and, thus, what the requirements for anonymization are.","2024","2025-02-19 14:56:34","2025-02-19 14:56:34","","105932","","","52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Data protection; GDPR; Privacy; Personal data; About element; Anonymisation; Purpose element; Result element; Risk-based approach; Risks to rights","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the proper application of incident tracking and incident policies, one can ensure that one responds when needed, and cuts out most of the extraneous issues. Incident response also depends on personnel. People require training, communication channels, and a proper process to follow. An Incident Response Policy (IRP) is important for the same reasons a security policy is important; namely, that it dictates how one reacts when the situation arises. There are many mistakes to be made and much trouble to get into if intrusions and security incidents are handled without a set response policy. This chapter explains how to create a team to handle security events, and how to build policies to ensure that events are tracked and handled correctly. It also explains how to interface with law enforcement officials, should one ever require their assistance.","2001","2025-02-19 14:56:34","2025-02-19 14:56:34","","515-551","","","","","","","The Only Way to Stop a Hacker is to Think Like One","","","","Syngress","Rockland","","","","","","","","DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-192899427-5/50013-4","","","","","","Russell, Ryan; Bidwell, Teri; Steudler, Oliver; Walshaw, Robin; Huston, L.

As fatal accidents of workers account for a significant number of construction accidents, considerable effort has been made to monitor workers’ safety behaviors with additional personnel for supervising workers. With the advancement of data analytics, recent research has reported various human activity recognition methods based on image data to perform automated worker monitoring without additional labor. Nevertheless, unlike existing approaches based on a single image, a method that can capture a series of actions from sequential images is required to monitor workers’ compliance with safety behavior. To this end, an approach based on OpenPose and a spatio-temporal graph convolutional network is proposed in this study to evaluate workers’ compliance with safety regulations using sequential videos. The two primary functions of the developed method include 1) classifying each safety behavior among five representative behaviors stipulated in construction, and 2) determining the compliance of workers with each safety regulation. The results indicate that the developed approach can capture momentary safety behaviors and workers’ compliance with feasible accuracy of an average F1 score greater than 0.8. Furthermore, the proposed method can be extended to safety intervention policies with behavior-based feedback to inform workers of their non-compliance with safety behaviors. Therefore, this study contributes to proactive safety management by focusing on workers’ behavioral levels rather than on accident rate-based management.","2023","2025-02-19 14:56:34","2025-02-19 14:56:34","","101942","","","56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Activity recognition; Computer-vision; Construction safety; Safety regulations; Spatio-temporal graph convolutional network (ST-GCN)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ICTs such as smart cameras, sound sensors and lighting technology are trying to infer and affect persons’ interests, preferences, emotional states, and behaviour. It should be no surprise then that contemporary legal and policy debates on privacy in smart cities are dominated by a debate focused on data and, therefore, on data protection law. In other words, data protection law is the go-to legal framework to regulate data processing activities within smart cities and similar initiatives. While this may seem obvious, a number of important hurdles might prevent data protection law to be (successfully) applied to such initiatives. In this contribution, we examine one such hurdle: whether the data processed in the context of smart cities actually qualifies as personal data, thus falling within the scope of data protection law. This question is explored not only through a theoretical discussion but also by taking an illustrative example of a smart city-type initiative – the Stratumseind 2.0 project and its living lab in the Netherlands (the Stratumseind Living Lab; SLL). Our analysis shows that the requirement of ‘identifiability’ might be difficult to satisfy in the SLL and similar initiatives. This is so for two main reasons. First, a large amount of the data at stake do not qualify as personal data, at least at first blush. Most of it relates to the environment, such as, data about the weather, air quality, sound and crowding levels, rather than to identified or even likely identifiable individuals. This is connected to the second reason, according to which, the aim of many smart city initiatives (including the SLL) is not to identify and target specific individuals but to manage or nudge them as a multiplicity – a combination of the environment, persons and all of their interactions. This is done by trying to affect the ‘atmosphere’ on the street. We thus argue that a novel type of profiling operations is at stake; rather than relying on individual or group profiling, the SLL and similar initiatives rely upon what we have called ‘atmospheric profiling’. We conclude that it remains highly uncertain, whether smart city initiatives like the SLL actually process personal data. Yet, they still pose risks for a wide variety of rights and freedoms, which data protection law is meant to protect, and a need for regulation remains.","2021","2025-02-19 14:56:34","2025-02-19 14:56:34","","105486","","","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Data protection; Personal data; Smart city; Nudging; Profiling; Stratumseind","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The conditions for the validity of this conceptual system model are discussed and the significance of task parameters such as grasp configuration, force distribution law and mechanical compliance values for the controller structure is explored. The dynamic behavior of internal and external compliance is determined in the second design phase by the choice of gain and integral action time of the respective controllers. An example shows the applicability of classical SISO control system design tools such as the root locus technique.

The regulatory framework, particularly that adopted in EU member states, reflected this pattern of relatively homogeneous deployment achieved, in part, by decades of cross-subsidised pricing and universal service goals. Perhaps because of this legacy, telecommunications regulators have often adopted the presumption that relevant markets are national in character, unless proven otherwise Although geographically-variegated regulatory remedies have been permitted (even in the face of allegedly national relevant markets) and adopted in many member states, many regulators have never done so, and overly cautious thresholds for permitting geographically based forbearance suggest a continued bias towards presuming national markets and remedies. We find that this presumption of uniformity and the tendency to aggregate geographic markets together is not supported by first principles of antitrust analysis, although there may have been strong practical reasons to apply this presumption in the past circumstances of the telecommunications and broadband industries. On the ground, however, there has arguably never been as much heterogeneity across geographies and across technological solutions that provide effective ultra-fast broadband speeds. Both technological (i.e., product market) and geographic heterogeneity are likely to increase with the advent of mobile 5G networks. With their deployment, a cautious regulatory stance towards geographic variation and a cautious regulatory stance towards inter-technology or inter-modal competition may result in regulation that could exceed what is required to ensure effective competition and could instead distort the incentives to enter of facilities-based actors. This may also result in higher-cost and inefficient investment. A more geographically varied and technologically agnostic regulatory framework may satisfy the principle of proportionate and focused regulation—with the possibility that the locus of regulation shifts from the access network to bottleneck facilities such as fibre, ducts and poles. This discussion is especially germane when one considers the highly speculative nature of forecasts and projections about future demand, and the competing claims of proponents of 5G and fibre. While there is some scepticism about the performance of mobile networks, we note that pure mobile and fixed 5G services may have synergies in deployment, and that the idea of competing with residential broadband services is a core strategy of very influential large-scale industry actors. In terms of a future research agenda, regulatory decisions could benefit from much more research into the relationship between domestic and global bandwidth constraints and their influence on development of software and application, as well as much more quantitative research by academics on the drivers of bandwidth demand. The risks associated with promoting investment that results in large-scale wasted resources should also be central to the regulatory agenda.","2021","2025-02-19 14:56:34","2025-02-19 14:56:34","","102042","","1","45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Regulation; Antitrust; Industrial organization; Market definition; Telecommunications","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper we describe the repair paradigm and prove several theorems which form a theoretical foundation for the repair procedures. We consider two applications of repair and present corresponding numerical results. The first application deals with improving properties of the remapping (conservative interpolation) stage of arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) methods for the gas dynamics equations, in which the solution is conservatively transferred from one mesh to another. One requirement for remapping is that the interpolated density and internal energy on the new mesh have to stay positive. Another desirable property is that the remapping procedure should not create new extrema for the velocity field. For various reasons these properties may not be satisfied, especially for high-order methods. Repair plays a supplemental role by bringing gas dynamics quantities into physically justified bounds. Another application of repair is to improve the quality of numerical methods for advection of some scalar tracer field with prescribed divergence-free velocity field, in which case the advection equation can be written as a conservation law, and therefore the total amount of tracer is conserved. We show how the repair procedure allows us to reduce oscillations in a numerical solution obtained by a formally high-order method. Repair offers an alternative to more classical methods of reducing oscillations and maintaining positivity.","2004","2025-02-19 14:56:34","2025-02-19 14:56:34","","265-277","","1","198","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Advection; Mass redistribution; Remapping; Repair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Concretely, we first define Ulam stability of (LIA). And the Ulam stability of (LIA) is then studied, that is, the fuzzy implications are sought to approximately fulfill (LIA) for some given aggregation functions.

In this paper, we argue that regulators should focus more on simple equity requirements instead of elaborating complex rules. Such a constraint in equity is however opposed by the banking industry because of its presumed adverse impact on banks’ performance. Using various techniques (Lasso, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, Artificial Neural Network) on a large dataset of banks’ balance sheet variables, we show that the equity ratio (equity over total assets) has a clear positive effect on banks’ performance when measured by the return on assets, while the impact of this ratio on the return on equity is most of the time negative. Strong equity requirements do not therefore impede banks’ performance, but do reduce the shareholder value. This may be the reason why the banking industry so fiercely opposes strong equity requirements. In addition, from a methodological perspective, we provide evidence that Random Forest performs better than other techniques at dealing with banks’ balance sheet data. Doing so, we provide avenues for future research dealing with these kind of data.","2022","2025-02-19 14:56:34","2025-02-19 14:56:34","","349-372","","1","301","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Artificial neural network; Banking regulation; Random forest; Support vector machine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Identity management seeks to solve this problem by making digital identities transferable across organisational boundaries. The basic idea is that the participating organisations will set up a collaboration (or circle of trust) which involves both identity providers and other service providers. However, there is a risk that identity management may reduce the users' level of privacy: Can the collaborating organisations collect personal information and create a profile which includes the user's interaction with all collaborators? Who is responsible for the processing of personal data if many organisations collaborate? How can the user make informed decisions and consent to the processing of his data? This article seeks to address these issues from the perspective of European data protection law. The paper is split into two parts.

However, the library retains the characteristics of an information unit and a business unit, regardless of its role as a firm-anchored department. The most compelling of its duties as a business unit is to provide value to its parent organization. The library is expected to contribute to the firm’s bottom line. The firm library community is alive with argument and agreement over the best methods of proving one’s value, whether library value is amenable to established financial metrics or if the end point is better understood as the administration’s acknowledgment of value in whatever form a particular library can offer. One mainspring of value is the library’s effective handling of its budget. Major challenges intrinsic to library finances include the changing needs of its main user groups, the shifting balance between print and electronic subscriptions, and the struggle to recover costs from clients for research time and database access. Librarians are expected to take a direct role in managing contracts and licenses. They also engage in aggressive marketing practices on behalf of the library itself. Another organizational concern is a library’s relationships with other offices and departments within the firm as well as with other library units. As information units, firm libraries are confronting the same trends as other types of libraries. A proliferation of formats has led to a re-conceptualization of the collection that goes beyond the library walls. Fresh approaches to service such as embedded librarianship are being explored. Also central to firm librarians’ duties as information experts are their obligations to train their users thoroughly on work-critical databases and to monitor that staff usage for the sake of copyright compliance.","2013","2025-02-19 14:56:34","2025-02-19 14:56:34","","125-164","","","","","","","Chandos Information Professional Series","","","","Chandos Publishing","","","","","","","","","DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-1-84334-708-8.50004-0","","","","contracts; budget; business value; collection development; copyright; cost recovery; embedded librarianship; finances; licensing; marketing; training; value imperative","","Azzolini, John","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Different laws and legislation have been introduced to standardize and strengthen data protection policies across different countries to protect such data. Therefore, businesses and organizations responsible for managing personal data are obligated to implement the privacy and security requirements established by these laws and legislation. Different methods and tools have been provided for eliciting requirements for legally compliant software based on the relevant data protection laws and legislation. However, little has been done in assessing these methodologies on regulations outside the EU and the US. This paper aims to assess these methodologies on other information security laws and regulations beyond the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) by eliciting security requirements explicitly focusing on the Nigerian data protection regulation. To investigate the applicability of these methodologies, we use the extracted privacy and security requirements with information communication protocols in verifying compliance in procedural practices of products and services in the financial technology sector. The analysis reports on the completeness, consistency, and utility of the frameworks. Finally, foundational research directions for interoperable standards for eliciting software requirements from legal texts are proposed.","2022","2025-02-19 14:56:34","2025-02-19 14:56:34","","102697","","","117","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Requirements engineering; Privacy by design; Privacy requirements; Information security compliance; Privacy laws; Privacy preservation; Requirements elicitation; Security and privacy; Security requirements; Software requirements","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To assist in determining current practice in the Australian Commonwealth and State Governments the results of an Australia wide survey of all government departments are given and contrasted to the major study for QPS. Reference is also made to the legal obligations for authorization of audit analysis, expert witnessing and legal precedence in relation to court acceptance or rejection of audit information used in evidence.

The actual implementation of laws surrounding intellectual property, privacy, reasonable searches, and breach notification will differ amongst various regions of the world, but the importance of these concepts is still universal. In order to begin to appreciate common legal concepts at work in today's global economy, an understanding of the major legal systems is required. These legal systems provide the framework that determines how a country develops laws pertaining to information systems in the first place. The three major systems of law are civil, common, and religious law. Civil law is employed by many countries throughout the world. The system of civil law leverages codified laws or statutes to determine what is considered within the bounds of law. Common law is the legal system used in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and most former British colonies, amongst others. Religious law serves as the third of the major legal systems. Religious doctrine or interpretation serves as a source of legal understanding and statutes.","2010","2025-02-19 14:56:34","2025-02-19 14:56:34","","405-439","","","","","","","","","","","Syngress","Boston","","","","","","","","DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-1-59749-563-9.00011-1","","","","","","Conrad, Eric; Misenar, Seth; Feldman, Joshua","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The reason for this is the almost exponential increase in electronic commerce transactions. For example, online retail in the United States accounted for 35.87 billion USD in 2001 and 47.98 billion USD in 2002. Online retail in the UK was only 0.4% of total retail in 1999, this figure rose to 4% in 2002.1 Most of the emphasis in the existing literature has been in regards to “conventional” online payment systems, such as credit and debit cards, and some other non-conventional payment methods such as the increasing legal interest in electronic money schemes.2 Nevertheless, there has been minimal interest in one of the fastest growing online payment methods – the popular Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) model of electronic commerce. With the marked increase in C2C transactions exemplified by auction sites such as eBay, a viable payment method for such operations must receive legal review. The present paper will analyse the C2C payment system exemplified by PayPal, and it will explore some of the most pressing legal questions which need answering, such as the regulatory status of PayPal.","2004","2025-02-19 14:56:35","2025-02-19 14:56:35","","293-299","","4","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some issues such as information security, privacy, and legal aspects of cloud computing may become challenging while cross passing with another complex domain like healthcare. Objectives The present study was conducted to report the results of a systematic literature review on the legal aspects of health cloud. Method The original English papers published in Pub Med, Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE Digital Library databases were extracted, among which1582 were related to the legal aspects of health cloud environment and were selected using predefined search strings. Conclusion Through the review process, effective factors in relation to a health cloud legal framework were identified and accordingly, a proper design was developed for this domain. Next, the identified factors were confirmed and adjusted by mapping the contents of the selected papers to different categories and subcategories under the proposed framework. Five Main categories like the issues related to the compliance, data protection, Identity Credential Access Management (ICAM), ownership, and quality of service were selected as the basic pillars in the proposed framework. Finally, 22 papers were selected, among which 19 were mapped to the compliance issues, 18 the issues related to “Data protection” were addressed, and 14 “Identity Credential Access Management (ICAM)” was discussed. Fifteen Papers were mapped to “Data ownership” and “Quality of service” categories. Some papers were found to present some solutions in all the mentioned areas; however, most of them have addressed only a few issues.","2019","2025-02-19 14:56:35","2025-02-19 14:56:35","","103953","","","132","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cloud computing; Healthcare; Privacy; Security; Legal framework","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the ever-increasing digitization of all aspects of life, companies are struggling to keep themselves and their customers secure. This is, at least in part, due to their focus on compliance to standards and regulations, they fall victim to a checkbox-mentality where compliance instead of security is seen as the goal. This strong focus on compliance creates security blind-spots and the negative impact it has on security is strengthened by the “pacing problem” – where technology evolves faster than the law. Thus, leaving a gap where there is a lack of legislation and enforcement for new technologies. In this opinion piece I argue that the responsibility for cybersecurity should be shared by governments and companies. To give companies the tools they need for ethical decision-making and thus truly take responsibility, I suggest combining the ethics of care with stakeholder theory to provide a context-based relational view of companies. With this caring stakeholder model, companies have the tools they need to transition from compliance to security.","2024","2025-02-19 14:56:35","2025-02-19 14:56:35","","105926","","","52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cybersecurity; Legislation; Care ethics; Cybersecurity standards; Pacing problem; Stakeholder theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some vendors provide easy terms and conditions in order to attract new partners and develop a wider network of partners in the targeted regions. In this study, the terms and conditions of SAP for certifying partners are studies and analyzed. In addition, case studies of two SAP partners are conducted. The primary research results suggest that the easy partnership conditions set by ERP vendors are among the main contributing factors for ERP projects failure in our cases. This finding is considered novel since most of the related work attributes failures to other factors, ignoring the vendor-partner terms and conditions.","2013","2025-02-19 14:56:35","2025-02-19 14:56:35","","527-535","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ERP; implementation failure; vendor-partner relationship","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper questions what role the emergent “right to repair” could play in resolving issues posed by the increasing ubiquity of the Internet of Things (IoT). The right gives consumers the ability and freedom to fix their devices, or to fair access to appropriate services that can carry out repair on their behalf. In this paper, firstly we establish the problem space surrounding consumer IoT – i.e., devices that are interconnected via the internet, enabling them to send and receive data. We reflect on hardware, software, and data components that pose legal and policy challenges for data protection, security, and sustainability. Through a literature review we then reflect on the current socio-legal developments that support or oppose changes in the consumer IoT market in regards to repair. We then highlight gaps in the existing literature that should inform future research trajectories in this area. This includes exploring disparities between environmental and consumer autonomy approaches, assessing consistency in regulatory developments, and market prioritisation. Finally, the paper concludes with a series of key insights and recommendations from our analysis including: recognition of the growing e-Waste problem and the inequalities it exacerbates and perpetuates; the need for identification and argumentation for different formulations of “repair” and how these may impact the implementation of a right going forward; the need for identification of the reasoning behind disparities in governmental approaches to the right to repair; and the need to practically translate better IoT design practices into reality.","2024","2025-02-19 14:56:35","2025-02-19 14:56:35","","105934","","","52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Consumer protection; Data; Repair; Environmental sustainability; IoT devices; Right to repair; Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Admittedly, modern life would be inconceivable without the services afforded by this type of processing in the field of electronic communications. At the same time public administrations are increasingly discovering the benefits of big data analytics afforded to them by telecommunications operators. Nevertheless, despite public attention and high volumes of expert analyses, the majority of approaches on the challenges to personal data protection by this type of data processing remains theoretical; Tellingly, the EDPS speaks of the “black box” of big data analytics. However, the authors were able to open, and stare into, the “black box” of big data analytics in the electronic communications field in 2017 and 2018 in the context of GDPR compliance assessments. Their analysis first attempts to set the legal scene today, answering two crucial questions on scope and applicable law, before presenting a typology for a scalable and granular approach that the authors feel is necessary but nevertheless is missing from the text of the draft ePrivacy Regulation. The authors therefore conclude that processing requirements and particularities, as evidenced under the big data analytics paradigm, make necessary a much more detailed approach than the one afforded by the draft ePrivacy Regulation today. Until these needs are met, through the introduction of a new, fundamentally amended text, the authors suggest that the current regulatory framework and the mechanisms afforded by it be extended for an interim period, so as to afford legislators with the necessary space and time to revise their work.","2020","2025-02-19 14:56:35","2025-02-19 14:56:35","","105397","","","36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Data protection; Privacy; Big data; Surveillance; Profiling; Algorithms; Chilling effects; Digital footprints; Inferences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its directions and identity are also impacted by the profound technology-based transformations in the information professions and in society at large. The digitization of ever more information items and the immediate Web-based accessibility of those items create new and heavy expectations from all users. The shape of firm librarianship’s future will be determined by these changes and the profession’s readiness to confront them. The Googlization of search and the rise of e-books are a few of the more conspicuous trends to be watched. However, firm librarians can best counter any intimations of disintermediation or obsolescence by responding effectively to the two defining qualities of law firm practice: the monetization of time and the contextualized complexity of legal knowledge.","2013","2025-02-19 14:56:35","2025-02-19 14:56:35","","205-219","","","","","","","Chandos Information Professional Series","","","","Chandos Publishing","","","","","","","","","DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-1-84334-708-8.50007-6","","","","corporate law firms; Dewey & LeBoeuf; disintermediation; e-books; economic downturn; Googlization; handhelds; mobile devices; technological innovation","","Azzolini, John","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At present the development of this industry and its marketplace has reached a level where standardization1 has become vitally important. One of the major reasons is that users in a multi-vendor environment require compatibility and interoperability of IT&T products. Standardization has become an issue of interest to both users and suppliers. In Europe, commitment to standardization is vital in creating an internal market. Without this internal market the European IT&T industry, of strategic importance to the EC, will not be able to survive in the struggle with Japan and the United States. Large buyers (governments, industry) are able to put pressure on the suppliers to conform to standards.2 Gradually, suppliers have conformed to a more serious approach to the standardization process and have realized that the former ‘lock-in’ effect of proprietary products has become a burden that locks out the supplier from a large part of the market.3 As Brock observes, in the IT&T industry standardization generally helps those firms trying to expand their marketshare and hurts those firms trying to defend their market against others4. For governments, standardization of IT&T products and services is an important instrument in regulating (international) trade and industry.5 This article offers an overview of a number of legal issues concerning standardization of information technology and telecommunications, focusing on developments in the EC. In most cases this will not imply a significant limitation on the scope of this article since IT&T developments have the same revolutionary characteristics all over the world and generally give rise to the same legal questions. This paper by Kees Stuurman, Attorney, provides a brief overview of the main characteristics of the process of IT&T standardization (organizations involved, interests, backgrounds, types of standards, figures). Subsequently, explorative analysis will consider the legal status of IT&T standards, the protection of standards documents, and the impact of standardization on liability and competition.","1992","2025-02-19 14:56:35","2025-02-19 14:56:35","","2-10","","1","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Roboticists become responsible not only for compliance to a set of regulatory objectives, but they also become responsible for giving machines an ability to make decisions in uncertain environments. All of this gives roboticists’ legal literacy a newfound importance, and reveals the lack of data on that population from a socio-legal angle. While we have some knowledge of lawyers’ and policy makers’ concerns for robots, we do not know how roboticists understand their relationship to law and regulation, or the legal value they attribute to various engineering processes. This article offers a preliminary exploration of that population and of their legal concerns, through interviews of ten engineers from Danish robotics companies. The analysis shows that they perceive legal concerns as dependant and integrated into their concerns for safety, which are themselves inferior to functionality and economy concerns. The article further highlights differences in understanding and perception of various legal matters by our informants, and from our practitioner perspective. Hopefully, highlighting these differences will by itself help close the gap between the two professions.","2022","2025-02-19 14:56:35","2025-02-19 14:56:35","","105711","","","47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Artificial intelligence; Safety; Chain of value; Engineering sociology; Robolaw; Robotics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this research, a decade of Australia’s retail franchise and trademark litigation cases are used as the corpus to analyze and synthesize the evolution of modern retail franchise law in Australia. The formal processes used in the legal e-discovery research include a LexisNexis search strategy to collect legal documents, text mining to find key concepts and their representing key phrases in the documents, clustering algorithms to associate the legal cases into groups, and concept lattice analysis to trace the evolutionary trends of the main groups. The case analysis discovers the fundamental issues for retail modernization, advantages and disadvantages of retail franchising systems, and the potential litigation hazards to be avoided in the Australian market. Given the growing number of legal documents in global court systems, this research provides a systematic and generalized CLI methodology to improve the efficiency and efficacy of research across international legal systems. In the context of the case study, the results demonstrate the critical importance of quickly processing and interpreting existing legal knowledge using the CLI approach. For example, a brand management company, which purchases a successful franchise in one market is under limited time constraints to evaluate the legal environment across global markets of interest. The proposed CLI methodology can be applied to derive market entry strategies to secure growth and brand expansion of a global franchise.","2015","2025-02-19 14:56:35","2025-02-19 14:56:35","","787-798","","4","29","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Collective litigation intelligence; Legal e-discovery; Retail franchise; Trademark infringement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

See the report TIRO, Teens and ICT: Risks and Opportunities (Cyberteens and cybertools), published by BELSPO, 2008. aims both at introducing the legal aspects of the protection of minors in cyberspace and analysing and criticizing certain main features embedded in this legal approach of young people protection. After a short introduction underlining the concept of child’s rights and the reason why this right has been particularly proclaimed in the context of the cyberspace, the first section describes the new technological features of the ICT environment and linked to this evolution the increasing risks the minors are confronted with. A typology of cyber abuses is proposed on the basis of these considerations. A list of EU or Council of Europe texts directly or indirectly related to the minors’ protection into the cyberspace is provided. The second section intends to analyse certain characteristics of the legal approach as regards the ways by which that protection is conceived and effectively ensured. Different principles and methods might be considered as keywords summarizing the legal approach and to a certain extent, fixing a partition of responsibilities taking fully into account the diversity of actors might be deduced from the different regulatory documents. The third section comes back to the different complementary means by which the Law is envisaging the minors’ protection. The obligation to create awareness about the potential risks minors might incur definitively is the first one. The omnipresent reference in all the legal texts to the role of self-regulatory interventions constitutes another pillar of the protection envisaged by the Law. After having described the multiple instruments developed in the context of this self-regulation (labels, codes of conduct, hotlines, ODR…) or even co-regulation, the paper examines the conditions set by the European legislators as regards these instruments. Technology might be considered as a fourth method for protecting children. Our concern will be to see how the Law is addressing new requirements as regards the technological solutions and their implementation. The present debates about the liability of the actors involved in applications or services targeted or not vis-à-vis the minors like SNS or VSP operators are evoked. As a final point the question of the increasing competences of LEA and the reinforcement of the criminal provisions in order to fight cyber abuses against minors will be debated. In conclusion, we will address final recommendations about the way by which it would be possible to reconcile effective minors’ protection and liberties into the cyberspace.","2011","2025-02-19 14:56:35","2025-02-19 14:56:35","","6-20","","1","27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Data protection; Privacy; Privacy by design; Profiling; Cyberspace law; e-Youth; Protection of minors; Social networking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Some particularly exorbitant clauses of these standard-agreements make it necessary to defend the customer more than usual. 1.a.

This obligation is part of a change of approach in the GDPR towards a modified compliance scheme in terms of a reinforced principle of accountability. The DPIA is a prominent example of this approach given that it has an inclusive, comprehensive and proactive nature. Its importance lies in the fact that it forces data controllers to identify, assess and ultimately manage the high risks to the rights and freedoms. However, what is first and foremost important for a meaningful performance of DPIAs, is to have a common and objective understanding of what constitutes a risk in the field of data protection and of how to assess its likelihood and severity. The legislature has approached these concepts via the method of denotation, meaning by giving examples of (highly) risky processing operations. This article suggests a complementary approach, the connotation of these concepts and explains the added value of such a method.

In this paper, we investigate, from a European legal and regulatory perspective, the growing interdependence and interactions of tangible and virtual elements in cloud robotics environments. We highlight specific problems and challenges in regulating such complex and dynamic ecosystems and explore potential solutions. To illustrate practical challenges, we consider several examples of cloud robotics ecosystems involving multiple parties, various physical devices, and various cloud services. These examples illuminate the complexity of interactions between relevant parties. By identifying pressing legal and regulatory issues in relation to cloud robotics, we hope to inform the policy debate and set the scene for further research.","2019","2025-02-19 14:56:35","2025-02-19 14:56:35","","77-91","","","119","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Cloud computing; Data protection; Policy; Law; Privacy; Robots; Product safety; Technology; Cloud; Cloud robotics; Cyber–physical system; Human–robot interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address this situation, one needs to understand the essence of the regulation with which one need to comply, map it to what it means in terms of the database environment, and implement a solution that will both comply with the requirements and is sustainable for the long run. Leading companies understand that in the same way that people continue to protect and insure houses and cars, they must continually invest in protecting valuable information. One incident that involves theft or destruction of proprietary information can easily pay for a 10-year investment, and serious incidents can cripple a company for lifetime. For those companies that have not come to this realization, regulators have created a large (and growing) set of regulations and frameworks aimed at enforcing protection of information, privacy, and transparency of information. These regulations sprung up in the past couple of years, prompted by some significant damages made to companies, and more important, to the public.","2005","2025-02-19 14:56:35","2025-02-19 14:56:35","","327-348","","","","","","","","","","","Digital Press","Burlington","","","","","","","","DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-155558334-7/50011-6","","","","","","Natan, Ron Ben","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The UWB bandwidth is the frequency band bounded by the points that are 10 dB below the highest radiated emission as based on the complete transmission system, including the antenna. Such factors as pattern coverage, pulse fidelity, return loss, gain, and efficiency should all be considered. However, the frequency domain is well suited for making regulatory measurements to existing EMC standards. The antenna to be used with a particular UWB product must be carefully selected to ensure optimum operation. Furthermore, only the antenna for which the UWB radio is authorized may be used with the device. Since UWB regulatory limits are specified in the frequency domain, the errors that could occur from any domain transformations are eliminated. UWB regulatory matters require that the antenna be a non-separable integrated part of the radio. UWB rules are different from any other existing spectrum regulations, and UWB transmitters must meet very stringent requirements to be allowed to operate. From a regulatory perspective, the differences between classical narrowband and UWB systems reside in the measurement details of the test instrumentation. Whether a system is determined to be wideband or narrowband from a regulatory standpoint is actually determined by the measurement receiver's resolution bandwidth or impulse response. Whether a measurement system is affected or influenced by a wideband or narrowband signal from a regulatory standpoint is determined by the support peripherals.","2006","2025-02-19 14:56:35","2025-02-19 14:56:35","","17-52","","","","","","","","","","","Newnes","Burlington","","","","","","","","DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-075067893-3/50003-1","","","","","","Aiello, Roberto; Batra, Anuj","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The development and spread of information and communication technology (ICT) created a set of conditions in which the participation of private actors (service providers in this case) appears to be a necessity. These conditions include, for example, a lack of physical borders for ICT technologies, the speed and width of the spread of information on the Internet, as well as the growth of technological behemoths. The resulting reaction can be seen in various sectors, such as combatting illicit content online or gathering digital evidence. While executing these roles they may be compelled – de jure or de facto – to make value judgments which traditionally belong to the public authorities. At the same time the legal framework is either lacking or it does not fully cover the consequences of this fundamental paradigm shift, to the detriment of the authorities, private actors and persons concerned. The objective of this article is to examine the most important features of these developments and analyse resulting key legal problems. The author demonstrates that the legal landscape of cooperation between law enforcement and service providers must be rethought and offers a direction for this reflection.","2021","2025-02-19 14:56:35","2025-02-19 14:56:35","","105614","","","43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Compliance; Digital services act; E-commerce; Digital capitalism; Digital evidence; Enforcement; Illicit content; Internet service providers; Liability exemption; Private actors; Terrorist content online regulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Kissinger With stuttering growth in the Western economies where major sourcing and TMT (Technology, Media & Telecoms) contracts are pervasive, it is perhaps not surprising that internal and external legal counsel are increasingly being called upon to advise clients on termination options and strategies to effect or oppose a threatened termination for breach of contract. This short paper considers why this has happened and the other factors which are in play which have meant that advice on termination and the renegotiation of contracts in this context has become more common. Expertise in this area is part of an IT lawyer’s tool kit and we consider that this is an area where internal and external legal counsel can make a substantial difference in delivering solutions to their clients. In this paper I talk about termination and renegotiation interchangeably. The reason for this as will become clear is that all forms of termination, whether they are consensual or contested, will involve some form of renegotiation of the terms of the contract between the parties. This is because it is almost impossible except perhaps in the simplest of installations to predict the nature in which a supplier or a customer may wish to change the services provided, and consequently even the most carefully crafted of exit and transition clauses, schedules and plans will require some form of post-contract negotiation between the customer, the outgoing supplier and potentially a new supplier or suppliers. This will necessarily involve some form of renegotiation of the terms of the contract between the parties. This paper looks at renegotiation in the context of a termination scenario rather than dealing with renegotiation during the normal course of operation of the contract.","2011","2025-02-19 14:56:35","2025-02-19 14:56:35","","641-646","","6","27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Exit and transit provisions; Termination for breach; TMT contracts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the direction, degree, and diversity of their association is unclear. To offer more robust and nuanced evidence to this issue of acute public concern, the current study presents a comprehensive meta-analysis of the associations between self-regulation and digital recreation from birth to adolescence – consolidating 183 studies reporting 232 associations from 234,476 children and adolescents. Across these studies, digital recreation clustered into investigations of screen time, features of problematic digital engagement, exposure to violent content, communicating with strangers online, sexting, and media multitasking. Although a pattern of negative bivariate associations was observed between self-regulation and aspects of digital recreation, the strength of association for screen time was weak (r = −.04 for computer use to r = −.15 for social media use). Once control variables were considered, relationships with exposure to violent digital content were rendered similarly trivial, suggesting other variables likely account for these correlations. This reduces our confidence in these associations. In contrast, lower self-regulation was more highly associated with problematic engagement (r = −.28 for problematic gaming to r = −.41 for problematic mobile phone use), communicating with strangers online (r = −.18), and sexting (r = −.20). This pattern of results points to a relationship that is variable by type of digital activity, which in our meta-analyses ranged from null to strong and negative. Where a relationship exists, it may be bi-directional given associations remained for longitudinal studies that positioned either self-regulation or digital recreation as predictor. Most moderators of these associations were non-significant, although the negative association of self-regulation with time spent gaming was increasingly strong with increasing participant age. This study instigates a disentangling of the nature of the relationship between self-regulation and digital choices and behaviours across the early stages of life.","2025","2025-02-19 14:56:35","2025-02-19 14:56:35","","108472","","","163","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Childhood; Digital media; Early childhood; Gaming; Mobile phone; Screen time; Self-control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While regulatory policy has therefore shifted towards innovation as its major goal besides enabling competition, there appear to be tensions between regulation, competition and innovation. This paper identifies as the roots of these tensions the consumer protection objective enshrined in regulatory legislation and the regulatory neutrality issues arising from stranded assets, loss of labor rents, loss of services by captive customers, and the threat to regulators from looming deregulation, all of which are associated with innovations. This paper identifies some similar threats to innovation in unregulated sunk-cost industries with a monopolistic incumbent. A very simple model shows that a comparison of innovation incentives in such an unregulated industry with a regulated one leads to ambiguous results. However, the prospect of converting a regulated industry into an unregulated one after the innovation has occurred will unambiguously increase innovation incentives.","2017","2025-02-19 14:56:35","2025-02-19 14:56:35","","802-812","","9","41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Entrant; Incumbent; Innovation; Next generation access network; Sunk cost","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

AI systems which perform relatively simple tasks in the early stages of the development period are expected to become fully or largely autonomous in the near future. Thanks to this, AI which includes the concepts of machine learning, deep learning, and autonomy, has begun to play an important role in producing and using smart arms. However, questions about AI-Based Lethal Weapon Systems (AILWS) and attacks that can be carried out by such systems have not been fully answered under legal aspect. More particularly, it is a controversial issue who will be responsible for the actions that an AILWS has committed. In this article, we discussed whether AILWS can commit offense in the context of the Rome Statute, examined the applicable law regarding the responsibility of AILWS, and tried to assess whether these systems can be held responsible in the context of international law, crime of aggression, and individual responsibility. It is our finding that international legal rules including the Rome Statute can be applied regarding the responsibility for the act/crime of aggression caused by AILWS. However, no matter how advanced the cognitive capacity of an AI software, it will not be possible to resort to the personal responsibility of this kind of system since it has no legal personality at all. In such a case, responsibility will remain with the actors who design, produce, and use the system. Last but not least, since no AILWS software does have specific codes of conduct that can make legal and ethical reasonings for today, at the end of the study it was recommended that states and non-governmental organizations together with manifacturers should constitute the necessary ethical rules written in software programs to prevent these systems from unlawful acts and to develop mechanisms that would restrain AI from working outside human control.","2021","2025-02-19 14:56:35","2025-02-19 14:56:35","","105564","","","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","International law; AI; Autonomy; Crime of aggression; IP law; IT law; Rome statute","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This regulation has also had a notable effect on the European Union (EU) candidate countries, which are undergoing the process of harmonizing their legislature with the EU as part of the accession process. The Republic of Serbia is an example of such a candidate country, and its 2018 Personal Data Protection Act mirrors the majority of provisions in the GDPR. This paper presents the impact of the GDPR on health data management and Serbia’s capability to conduct international health data research projects. Data protection incidents reported in Serbia are explored to identify common underlying causes using a novel taxonomy of contributing factors across aspects and health system levels. The GDPR has an extraterritorial application for the non-EU data controllers who process the data of EU citizens and residents, which mainly affects private practices used by medical tourists from the EU, public health care institutions frequented by foreigners, as well as expatriates, dual citizens, tourists, and other visitors. Serbia generally does not have well-established procedures to support international research collaborations around its health data. For smaller projects, contractual arrangements can be made with health data providers and their ethics committees. Even then, organizations that have not previously participated in similar ventures may require approval or support from health authorities. Extensive studies that involve multisite data typically require the support of central health system institutions and relevant research data aggregators or electronic health record vendors. The lack of a framework for preparation, anonymization, and assurance of privacy preservation forces researchers to rely heavily on local expertise and support. Given the current limitation and potential issues with the legislation, it remains to be seen whether the move toward the GDPR will be beneficial for the Serbian health system, medical research, protection of personal data and privacy rights, and research capacity. Although significant progress has been made so far, a strategic approach is needed at the national level to address insufficient resources in the area of data protection and develop the personal data protection environment further. This will also require a targeted educational effort among health workers and decision makers, aiming to improve awareness and develop skills and knowledge necessary for the workforce.","2020","2025-02-19 14:56:35","2025-02-19 14:56:35","","","","4","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","public policy; data sharing; legal aspects; ethical issues; health care systems; information disclosure; international aspects; medical tourists; patient data privacy; policy compliance; privacy act","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Also if the cloud industry is aware of this legislation/regulation compliance issue (e.g. the compliance program of Amazon, Google and Microsoft Azure), right now, there are nor reference architectures neither mechanisms capable to check and to assure, off-line and at run-time, that the compliance is guaranteed during the whole life cycle of a cloud service.

The adoption of this risk-based approach has not come without a number of debates and controversies, notably on the scope and meaning of the risk-based approach. Yet, what has remained up to date out of the debate is the very notion of risk itself, which underpins the whole risk-based approach. The contribution uses the notions of risk and risk analysis as tools for describing and understanding risk in the GDPR. One of the main findings is that the GDPR risk is about “compliance risk” (i.e., the lower the compliance the higher the consequences upon the data subjects' rights). This stance is in direct contradiction with a number of positions arguing for a strict separation between compliance and risk issues. This contribution sees instead issues of compliance and risk to the data subjects rights and freedoms as deeply interconnected. The conclusion will use these discussions as a basis to address the long-standing debate on the differences between privacy impact assessments (PIAs) and DPIAs. They will also warn against the fact that ultimately the way risk is defined in the GDPR is somewhat irrelevant: what matters most is the methodology used and the type of risk at work therein.","2018","2025-02-19 14:56:35","2025-02-19 14:56:35","","279-288","","2","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","GDPR; Risk; Data protection and privacy impact assessments","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current Israeli case law, which shows that the balance between privacy and free speech in cases of publication of private information leans toward privacy, can be partially explained by historical, religious and cultural reasons.

Our analysis shows that social media users have the same rights when exercising freedom of expression as professional journalists. In our opinion equalising the legal status of an ordinary publication with a press release, both from the perspective of Article 10 of the ECHR and Article 85 of the GDPR, takes place under certain conditions.

This variety of applications should be unsurprising given the multitude of tasks that are connected with the law, the variety of ways in which such tasks can be supported, and the apparent multiplicity of competing material that could be used as the basis of a legal knowledge base. This chapter discusses the various sources and explains how the knowledge used can serve to define the task, and vice versa. In turn, this means that specifying the task that one wishes to support can help to identify the knowledge that one needs to incorporate in the KBS.","1991","2025-02-19 14:56:35","2025-02-19 14:56:35","","329-342","","","36","","","","APIC","","","","Academic Press","London","","","","","","","","DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-086441-6.50024-6","","","","","","BENCH-CAPON, T.

A subset of CPP-TRS visuals, indicating those categories which create communicative context, precisely textual signs and textual symbols, have been recently isolated and converted into functions and commands of a mark-up language for documentation annotation. The newly derived special purpose language is called CTML, which means Context Transport Markup Language, [4] and the main objective to be achieved is accurate incorporation of contextual features into documentation. Communicative function carried by signs, together with communicative intention carried by symbols and communicative turn-taking carried by turn-taking symbols create context, which may be easily incorporated within each single instruction, that has been produced in textual format. Instructions displayed according to a set of categories selected as the most relevant ones will provide users with those interpretive clues which are needed to support accurate and effective understanding of each instructional sequence. Strategic information, such as legal, medical, bureaucratic text and safety protocols are, if designed and packaged according to the CTML standard [5] may be easily and effectively stored, retrieved, accessed, distributed and updated; therefore significantly enhancing power and speed in the search process as well.","2001","2025-02-19 14:56:36","2025-02-19 14:56:36","","152-161","","","43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
